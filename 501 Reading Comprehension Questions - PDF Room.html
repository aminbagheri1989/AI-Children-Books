<p><span class=rvts6>Introduction</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Are you having trouble &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;with reading comprehension questions on </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tests? Do you want to know how to improve your reading ability or pass </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>placement tests in school or work? If so, then this book is for you. Read on </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to ind out why.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Maybe you already like to read and want to use this book to sharpen </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>your skills for an important test. If so, that’s ine. In fact, you can skip </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>this part of the Introduction—or skip the Introduction entirely—and go </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>straight to the questions.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>But maybe you’re one of the millions of people who have trouble with </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>reading, especially with reading carefully while reading quickly. If so, this </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Introduction will give you some direction.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>First, know that you’re not alone. It’s a fact that some people relate more </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>easily to numbers or to working with their hands. Still, no other general skill </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>is used more regularly—in work, play, and just plain living—than reading. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The good news is that reading well is a skill that can be developed with prac-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tice. This book will help, but something else will help even more: If you’re </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>serious &nbsp;about &nbsp;developing &nbsp;your &nbsp;reading &nbsp;comprehension &nbsp;skills, &nbsp;go &nbsp;to &nbsp;the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>library or a bookstore and pick out books on subjects you ind fascinating.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>For instance, if your interests are in skydiving, biking, golf, scuba diving, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>race cars, camping, woodworking, or even the stock market, use that as a </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>starting point, and choose a book. The subject will undoubtedly draw you </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in because you are already interested. Begin to read. You will ind that as </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>you focus on the subject matter, you will already know some of the infor-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>mation. But chances are you will discover something new as you read, and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>you can connect this with your prior knowledge. Eventually, your store of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>information becomes quite admirable. Repeat the process over and over </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>again. As you do, you will improve your reading comprehension skills, and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>it won’t even seem like a chore.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>A Look at Our Book</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The irst ive sections cover the basics—from vocabulary to topic sentences. &nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>501 Reading Comprehension Questions, 4th Edition &nbsp; begins with vocabulary </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>because that’s what you need to read—the essential building blocks. You </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>will ind vocabulary questions that test your ability to ind deinitions and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>context clues. Next, the analogy questions take you a step further. When </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>answering analogy questions, you will learn to develop your ability to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>compare and contrast, ind similarities and differences, and relate parts </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to whole pieces. Just in case you’re wondering why this is important, you </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>should know that the skills you develop from these short exercises in word </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>play will assist you when you are reading longer passages. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>As the book progresses, you will be asked to read short, interesting para-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>graphs to ind main ideas and topic sentences. Once you are comfortable </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>with these basic skills, proceed to the passages in the last ive sections. This </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>is where you will use your skills to tackle longer passages.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The last ive sections begin with one- to two-paragraph passages. Ques-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tions following these passages ask you to identify details and facts, choose </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the main idea, make inferences, or analyze and interpret the text. The </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>passages, both iction and noniction, get longer as you progress through </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the book, and they all have varied subjects.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Some are about computers, geology, or geography, while others are about </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>poems, philosophy, literature, or art. You will even ind some charts and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>graphs. You may want to take notes as you read. This technique of interact-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ing with the text is good to use anytime you read or when you take a test that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>includes reading comprehension.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The answers to every question are at the back of the book. Each answer </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>is fully explained, so if you have trouble with a particular question, you will </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>be able to igure out how to arrive at the correct answer.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>How to Use Our Book</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>This book is best used to build your critical reading and thinking skills, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>but you might want to support it with some other LearningExpress Skill </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Builders books. When it comes to perfecting your reading comprehension, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>don’t ignore any of the other language skills. You will ind &nbsp; Writing Skills </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Success in 20 Minutes a Day, Vocabulary and Spelling Success in 20 Minutes a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Day, 501 Logic and Reasoning Problems, &nbsp; and &nbsp; 1001 Vocabulary and Spelling </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Questions &nbsp; to be indispensable guides. In any case, the more you use the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>language and understand the building blocks, the easier and faster you will </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>breeze through those reading comprehension passages that you ind on </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>most tests.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Working on Your Own</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>If you are working alone to brush up on the basics and prepare for a test in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>connection with a job or school, you will want to develop a time schedule </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and know your learning style. Since everyone reads differently, the number </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of words or pages you can cover in a given time period may be more or less </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>than one section of this book. That’s okay. Just spend 20 minutes—more </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>or less—reading the material and going through the exercises. Don’t worry </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>about how much material you’re covering. It’s important that you’re prac-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ticing, and chances are that your speed will improve as you go through the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>book. Your job is to ind your pace.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Then, know your learning style. Do you learn best in a quiet room, or </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>do you need music in the background? Whatever the case may be, ind the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>location that best suits you. Do you need to take notes to remember facts </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and details? Have a pen, pencil, highlighter, and notebook ready. Are you </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>at your best early in the morning or late at night? Pick the best time, get </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>comfortable, and begin.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Tutoring Others</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>501 Reading Comprehension Questions, 4th Edition &nbsp; will work well in combina-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tion with almost any basic reading or English text. You will probably ind it </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>most helpful to give your student(s) a brief lesson on the topic (main idea, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>fact/detail, inference, etc.), and then have them spend the remainder of the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>class or session reading the passages and answering the questions. When </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>you inish, take some time for a brief review session.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Vocabulary</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Understanding the words used &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to construct sentences is the best </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>way to begin practicing for a reading comprehension test. Using a diction-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ary is, of course, the best way to deine a word. Get into the habit of using </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a dictionary as you work through this book. Make it part of your basic study </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>materials, and keep it right beside you as you go through this book. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>But if you’re in a testing situation and you are not allowed to use one, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>rely on the context clues in the sentence. The term &nbsp; context clues &nbsp; means that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>other words in the sentence “give away” or give clues to the deinition. For </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>example, sometimes you will ind synonyms (words that mean the same </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>thing) or antonyms (words that mean the opposite), or details that lead you </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to identify the vocabulary word in question. Once in a while, you will ind a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>group of words set off by commas (called an appositive), which gives you a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>very clear deinition of the word.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>COntext</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The words, phrases, and sentences surrounding an unfamiliar </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>word. The context can help you make an educated guess about </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a new word or phrase.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Answers</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;1. &nbsp; &nbsp;c. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To be &nbsp; outmoded &nbsp; is to be old-fashioned or &nbsp; out-of-date &nbsp;. The </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>designer window treatments may also be unnecessary, point-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>less, or even worthless. However, the key to the meaning is the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>context—that is, the phrase &nbsp; installed 17 years ago &nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;2. &nbsp; &nbsp;c. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Something that is &nbsp; covert &nbsp; is hidden. It is related to the word &nbsp; cover &nbsp;; </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;3. &nbsp; &nbsp;a. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To be &nbsp; spiteful &nbsp; is to be vengeful or &nbsp; vindictive &nbsp;. The keys here are </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;4. &nbsp; &nbsp;d. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When something is done &nbsp; obdurately &nbsp;, it is done in an inlexible </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>or intractable manner, or &nbsp; stubbornly &nbsp;. The key here is the words </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>willful young man &nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;5. &nbsp; &nbsp;b. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A &nbsp; supericial &nbsp; remark is insigniicant and shallow, or &nbsp; petty &nbsp;. The </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;6. &nbsp; &nbsp;a. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Something &nbsp; blatant &nbsp; is done openly and boldly; it is obvious, out </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;7. &nbsp; &nbsp;b. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Something that is &nbsp; lamboyant &nbsp; is lashy or &nbsp; showy &nbsp;. The keys here </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>are the words &nbsp; usually described as lamboyant &nbsp; and &nbsp; but &nbsp; . . . &nbsp; uncharac-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>teristically modest.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;8. &nbsp; &nbsp;b. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To be &nbsp; gullible &nbsp; means to be easy to fool or &nbsp; naïve &nbsp;. The keys here </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 9. &nbsp; &nbsp;a. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A &nbsp; prerequisite &nbsp; is something that is necessary or &nbsp; required &nbsp;. The fact </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>that you can’t become a certiied teacher without completing </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the student teaching assignment means it is required. The other </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>choices do not imply a hard and fast rule.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;10. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; To be &nbsp; diligent &nbsp; is to be painstaking or &nbsp; thorough &nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>at intervals.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;14. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; The word &nbsp; vicarious &nbsp; means experienced through the efforts of </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;56. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; The passage implies that the other women in the orchestra </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>were conventional because of the way they dressed and wore </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>their hair. Because Robin does things differently, she would be </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>considered &nbsp; unconventional &nbsp;. The other choices, although she may </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>be joyful, unreliable, and proud, have nothing to do with the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>context of this sentence, which is directly addressing her appear-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ance as it compares to the other women in the orchestra.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;57. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; The author puts emphasis on Donna’s habit of upsetting people </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>at work. She has “offended almost everybody,” and is a “con-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sistent nuisance.” The author concludes that Donna should be </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ired, indicating that he’s had enough of her trouble-making. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The word &nbsp; exasperated &nbsp; means that the author has reached the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>limit of his patience.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;58. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; Something that is &nbsp; caustic &nbsp; is acidic—it burns or bites.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;59. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;Contention &nbsp; in this sense means discord or anger.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Analogies</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The dictionary deines an &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;analogy &nbsp; as a “similarity in some respects </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>between things that are otherwise dissimilar.” In each of the questions </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>contained in this section, you will ind a pair of related words. These words </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>are separated by a colon, like this:</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ish : scales</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Read that to yourself as if the colon were the words “is to”—“ish &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is to</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>scales.” Then, as you read through the possible answers, add “as” to the begin-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ning of each answer—“ish is to scales &nbsp;horse is to barn,” and so forth. &nbsp;as </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Look at those words and try to igure out how they are connected to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>one another. For example, what is the connection between the words &nbsp; ish &nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and &nbsp; scales &nbsp;? Obviously, a ish is covered with scales; now think of two other </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>analOgY</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Comparing two things that are not related in order to ind simi-</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>words that share a similar relationship. A good example of this would be </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>bird &nbsp; and &nbsp; feathers &nbsp;. The similarity between these two unrelated pairs of words </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>is an analogy. The best way to approach an analogy question is to make up </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a sentence that describes the relationship between the irst two words and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ind another pair in the choices that would it into that same sentence. A </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Main Ideas, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Themes</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Finding the &nbsp; main idea &nbsp; or &nbsp; theme &nbsp; of a written piece is one of the most </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>important aspects of good reading comprehension. It is, however, easy to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>confuse the &nbsp; main idea &nbsp; or &nbsp; theme &nbsp; with the &nbsp; subject &nbsp;. Basically, the &nbsp; subject &nbsp; of a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>piece of writing is what that piece is &nbsp; generally &nbsp; about, plain and simple—the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>facts and information. However, when you look past the facts and informa-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tion to the heart of what writers are trying to say, and why they are saying </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>it, that’s the main idea or theme. For example, the subject of this introduc-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tion is about distinguishing between a subject and a main idea or theme; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the main idea or theme is why it’s important to be able to recognize that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>difference. The main idea is the point that the writer is trying to help the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>reader understand, whereas the topic is what the writer is using to get a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>main ideas across.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Read the following paragraphs and carefully determine what the &nbsp; main idea &nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>is for each. The best way to approach these questions is to irst read the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>paragraph and then, in your own words, restate what you think the author </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>is trying to say. From the ive choices, select the one statement that best </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>supports the author’s point.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>the onion’s strong lavor.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>in the United States want an anthology that includes the complete </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>works of William Shakespeare. And what accounts for this renewed </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>interest in Shakespeare? As scholars point out, the psychological </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>insights he portrays in both male and female characters are amazing </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>even today.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 102. &nbsp; This paragraph best supports the statement that</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; Shakespeare’s characters are more interesting than ictional </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>characters today.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; people today are interested in Shakespeare’s work because of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the characters.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; academic scholars are putting together an anthology of Shake-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>speare’s work.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; New Yorkers have a renewed interested in the work of Shake-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>speare.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>e. &nbsp; Shakespeare was a psychiatrist as well as a playwright.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Critical reading is a demanding process. To read critically, you must </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>slow down your reading and, with pencil in hand, perform speciic </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>operations on the text. Mark up the text with your reactions, conclu-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sions, and questions. When you read, become an active participant.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 103. &nbsp; &nbsp;This paragraph best supports the statement that</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; critical reading is a slow, dull, but essential process.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; the best critical reading happens at critical times in a person’s </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>life.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; readers should get in the habit of questioning the truth of what </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>they read.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; critical reading requires thoughtful and careful attention.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>e. &nbsp; critical reading should take place at the same time each day.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>There are no effective boundaries when it comes to pollutants. Stud-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ies have shown that toxic insecticides that have been banned in many </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>countries are riding the wind from countries where they remain legal. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Compounds such as DDT and toxaphene have been found in remote </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>places like the Yukon and other Arctic regions.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 104. &nbsp; &nbsp;This paragraph best supports the statement that</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; toxic insecticides such as DDT have not been banned throughout </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the world.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; more pollutants ind their way into polar climates than they do </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>into warmer areas.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; studies have proven that many countries have ignored their own </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>anti-pollution laws.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; DDT and toxaphene are the two most toxic insecticides in the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>world.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>e. &nbsp; even a worldwide ban on toxic insecticides would not stop the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>spread of DDT pollution.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution protects citizens against </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>or personal effects may be conducted without a written search war-</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>approve the factual basis justifying a search before it can be con-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ducted.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 105. &nbsp; &nbsp;This paragraph best supports the statement that the police cannot </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Mathematics allows us to expand our consciousness. Mathematics </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tells us about economic trends, patterns of disease, and the growth </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of populations. Math is good at exposing the truth, but it can also </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>perpetuate misunderstandings and untruths. Figures have the power </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to mislead people.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 106. &nbsp; &nbsp;This paragraph best supports the statement that</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; the study of mathematics is dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; words are more truthful than igures.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; the study of mathematics is more important than other &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>disciplines.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; the power of numbers is that they cannot lie.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>e. &nbsp; igures are sometimes used to deceive people.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Black-and-white camera ilm, in the old days of ilm photography, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>was very sensitive to blue light but not to red light. Blue skies would </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>often show very little detail, because the ilm couldn’t record all that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>it was seeing. To compensate, photographers would put a red ilter </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>on the lens, darkening the sky enough that the ilm could record its </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>luffy clouds.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 107. &nbsp; &nbsp;This paragraph best supports the statement that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; red ilters were very popular in the old days of photography.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; infrared rays are invisible to the naked eye.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; black-and-white photography used to be very popular.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Today’s postal service is more eficient than ever. Mail that once took </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>months to move by horse and foot now moves around the country in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>days or hours by truck, train, and plane. If your letter or package is </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>urgent, the U.S. Postal Service offers Priority Mail and Express Mail </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>services. Priority Mail is guaranteed to go anywhere in the United States </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in two days or less. Express Mail will get your package there overnight.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;108. &nbsp; &nbsp;This paragraph best supports the statement that</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a &nbsp;. &nbsp;more people use the post ofice for urgent deliveries than any </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>other delivery service.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; Express Mail is a good way to send urgent mail.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; &nbsp;Priority Mail usually takes two days or less.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; mail service today is more effective and dependable.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>e. &nbsp; &nbsp;mail was once delivered by horse and foot.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Reality TV shows will have an adverse effect on traditional dramas </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and comedies. As reality TV increases in popularity, network execu-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tives will begin canceling more traditional programs and replacing </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>them with the latest in reality TV.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;109. &nbsp; &nbsp;This paragraph best supports the statement that</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; &nbsp;reality TV is low quality.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; reality TV shows get the highest ratings.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; &nbsp;more and more people love to watch and participate in reality TV.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; as reality TV gets more popular, more traditional television </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>shows may be threatened.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>e. &nbsp; &nbsp;network executives make hasty and unwise decisions.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>When winding an old clock, it is important not to overwind it. Over-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>winding occurs when the mainspring is almost fully wound, but the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>operator continues to turn the winding key. This causes the main </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>spring to coil too tightly, and might even break it.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;110. &nbsp; &nbsp;This paragraph best supports the statement that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; &nbsp;clocks have changed over the years.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; old-fashioned clocks become fragile with age.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; &nbsp;old-fashioned clocks were operated by an internal spring.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; overwinding clocks used to be a common mistake.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;Answers</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>101. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The passage speaks speciically about onions and bay leaves in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>clam chowder—not about soups in general, and thus choice &nbsp; &nbsp; b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>is not correct. No mention is made to nutrition or poison, nor </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>does the passage address over-cooked clams.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;102. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The last sentence in the paragraph clearly supports the idea that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the renewed interest in Shakespeare is due to the development </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of his characters. Choice &nbsp; is incorrect because the writer never &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>makes this type of comparison. Choice &nbsp; is wrong, because even &nbsp; c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>though scholars are mentioned in the paragraph, there is no in-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>dication that the scholars are compiling the anthology. Choice </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d &nbsp; is wrong because there is no support to show that most New </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Yorkers are interested in this work. There is no support for </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>choice &nbsp;. &nbsp;e</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;103. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;This answer is implied by the whole paragraph. The author </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>stresses the need to read critically by performing operations </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>on the text in a slow and speciic manner. Choice &nbsp; is incorrect &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>because the author never says that reading is dull. Choices &nbsp;, , &nbsp; b &nbsp;c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and &nbsp; are not supported by the paragraph. &nbsp;e</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;104. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; The support for this choice is in the second sentence, which </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>states that in some countries, toxic insecticides are still legal. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Choice &nbsp; is incorrect because even though polar regions are &nbsp; b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>mentioned in the paragraph, there is no support for the idea </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>that warmer regions are not just as affected. There is no support &nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>for choice &nbsp;. Choice &nbsp; can be ruled out because there is nothing &nbsp; c &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to indicate that DDT and toxaphene are the most toxic. Choice </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>e &nbsp; is illogical.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;105. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; The second and third sentence combine to give support to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>choice &nbsp;. The statement stresses that there must be a judge’s &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>approval (i.e., legal authorization) before a search can be con-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ducted. Choices &nbsp; and &nbsp; are wrong because it is not enough &nbsp; b &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>for the police to have direct evidence or a reasonable belief—a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>judge must authorize the search for it to be legal. Choices &nbsp; and &nbsp; c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>e &nbsp; are not mentioned in the passage.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;106. &nbsp; e. &nbsp; &nbsp;This answer is clearly stated in the last sentence of the para-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>graph. Choice &nbsp; can be ruled out because there is no support &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to show that studying math is dangerous. Words are not men-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tioned in the passage, which rules out choice &nbsp;. There is no &nbsp; b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>support for choice &nbsp;. Choice &nbsp; is a contradiction to the infor- &nbsp;c &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>mation in the passage. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;107. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The passage addresses the fact that a red ilter could remove </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>some blue light in black and white photography, so choice &nbsp; is &nbsp; d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>best. No mention is made of infrared light or of the popularity </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of black-and-white photography, and choice &nbsp; is the exact op- &nbsp;e</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>posite of what the passage states.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;108. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;Choices &nbsp; and &nbsp; are not supported by the paragraph. Choices &nbsp; &nbsp; a &nbsp;c &nbsp;b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and &nbsp; only tell us about particular parts of the paragraph and are &nbsp; e</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>too speciic to be the main idea. Choice &nbsp;, however, is general &nbsp; d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>enough to encompass all the sentences and the paragraph as a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>whole. Every sentence supports the idea asserted in choice &nbsp;. &nbsp; d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;109. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;Both sentences in the paragraph support this choice. Choices &nbsp; &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and &nbsp; are opinions and are not in the paragraph. Choices &nbsp; and &nbsp; e &nbsp;b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c &nbsp; may be true, but they are also not supported by the paragraph.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;110. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; The passage cautions against overwinding, stating that it can </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>break the clock’s main spring. From this, one can infer that the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>clock is run by a spring. The other choices may or may not be </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>true, but they are not addressed in the passage.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Topic Sentences</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>In the last section, &nbsp; you learned what a main idea is. Often, writers </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>express their main idea in a clearly deined sentence known as a &nbsp; topic sentence &nbsp;. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Topic sentences are usually found at the beginning of a paragraph in order </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to immediately establish the main idea. But this is not always the case—</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>topic sentences can be found anywhere in a paragraph, and sometimes, the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>author chooses not to use one at all. Still, looking for the topic sentence is a </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 111. &nbsp; &nbsp;The term &nbsp; spices &nbsp; is a pleasant one, whether it connotes ine </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>French cuisine or a down-home, cinnamon-lavored apple pie. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>____________. In the past, individuals traveled the world seeking </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>exotic spices for proit and, in searching, have changed the course </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of history. Indeed, to gain control of lands harboring new spices, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>nations have actually gone to war.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; The taste and aroma of spices are the main elements that make </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>food such a source of fascination and pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; The term might equally bring to mind Indian curry made thou-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sands of miles away and those delicious barbecued ribs sold on </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the corner.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; It is exciting to ind a good cookbook and experiment with </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>spices from other lands—indeed, it is one way to travel around </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the globe!</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; The history of spices, however, is another matter altogether, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and at times, it can be illed with danger and intrigue.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 112. &nbsp; &nbsp;It weighs less than three pounds and is hardly more interesting to look </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>nerve endings.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; The science of neurology has found a way to map the most </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>important areas of the human brain.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; Nevertheless, the human brain is the most mysterious and com-</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; The Greek hero valued self-interest above loyalty to a cause, his </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>king, or to his army, just as the free-agent superstar values his </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>For the inal two questions, choose the sentence that does not support the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>given topic sentence.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 129. &nbsp; &nbsp;In ancient Greece, honor was not just the domain of the warrior.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; A great orator [speaker], who could sway the public with his </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>logic and wit, was greatly respected.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; A revered poet’s name lived on long after he died.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; Great wealth was characteristic of the truly great kings.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; A warrior’s quest for the esteem of his peers would bring him </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>great prizes, which would secure a long-lasting reputation.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 130. &nbsp; &nbsp;In &nbsp; Moby Dick &nbsp;, Herman Melville wrote that the whale men were </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>“enveloped in whale lines,” that each man relied on the others dur-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ing moments of danger.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; The small boats that pursued the whales left the whaling ship </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>far behind; each man in a boat had to depend on the others to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>stay alive.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; Once the whale was harpooned, the whale line unraveled so fast </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>that water had to be poured on it to keep it from smoking.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; The whale line was the rope, dozens of yards long, that attached </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to the harpoon; it was raveled under the seats of all the men </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>metaphorically connecting each man to the next.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; One wrong move and the line would snap a man right out of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the boat; thus, his life depended on whether the crew would </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>cut the whale loose to save him, or leave him in the ocean dur-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ing the heat of the hunt.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;111. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The mention that searching for spices has changed the course </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of history, and that for spices, &nbsp; nations have . . . gone to war, &nbsp; im-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>plies that the subject of the paragraph is history. These phrases </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>also connote danger and intrigue.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;112. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; The mention of all the amazing things the brain is capable of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>is directly relevant to its being mysterious and complex. The </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>heat transfer. Only choice &nbsp;continues that topic. &nbsp;a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>115. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;This choice is the only one that supports and develops the topic </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sentence. The other choices all say something about cosmetic </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>plastic surgery, but they do not support the topic sentence, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>which states that cosmetic plastic surgery is one of the fastest-</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;116. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; All of the choices do address cars skidding on ice, but only </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>long-lasting reputation.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>safety. Choice &nbsp; states this idea explicitly: Each man “had to &nbsp; a</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>everything you’ve learned so far. Pay special attention to the details and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the facts, and make a habit of trying to identify the author’s main idea; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>also, try to think of the author’s motive for writing the passage. Ask the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>questions, “ &nbsp;Who? What? When? Where? How? &nbsp; and &nbsp; Why? &nbsp;” Is the author’s </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>purpose to inform you of facts, persuade you of something, or simply to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>entertain you?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>As you read, try marking up the passages or taking notes. The more </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>active a reader you are, the more likely that you will understand and fully </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>enjoy what you read.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Using information that is stated in a passage to draw a conclusion </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>that is &nbsp; not &nbsp; stated. For example, “The furry animal sat in her master’s </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>lap, purring contently.”</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>You might conclude that the “furry animal” is a cat, given the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>information—and that would be an inference.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>The answers to this section begin on page 79.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Some of the questions following the passages ask you to make &nbsp; inferences &nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>from the passages. To &nbsp; infer &nbsp; means to arrive at a conclusion by reasoning </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>from evidence. Synonyms for &nbsp; infer &nbsp; are &nbsp; deduce judge &nbsp;, &nbsp; , or &nbsp; conclude &nbsp;. If you are </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>told to &nbsp; infer &nbsp; something from a passage, you are basically being asked what </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>conclusions can be drawn from the content of the story. Tip: If you replace </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the word &nbsp; infer &nbsp; with &nbsp; conclude &nbsp; in a question, it may make more sense to you.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>In cities throughout the country, there is a new direction in local </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>campaign coverage. Frequently in local elections, journalists are not </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>giving voters enough information to understand the issues and evalu-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ate the candidates. The local news media devotes too much time to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>scandal and not enough time to policy.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 131. &nbsp; &nbsp;This paragraph best supports the statement that the local news </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>media</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; is not doing an adequate job when it comes to covering local </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>campaigns.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; does not understand either campaign issues or politics.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; should learn how to cover politics by watching the national </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>quality documents such as newsletters, business cards, letterhead, </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>important part of any DTP project is planning. Before you begin, </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The entire low-carbohydrate versus low-fat diet argument is so </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>prevalent that one would think that these are the only two options </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>available for losing weight and staying healthy. Some experts even </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>feel that the low-carb/low-fat debate distracts us from an even more </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>important issue—our culture’s reliance on processed and manufac-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tured foods. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;133. &nbsp; &nbsp;The paragraph best supports the statement that</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; &nbsp;experts state that not all fats are equal, so we need not reduce </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>our intake of all fats; just those that contain partially hydroge-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>nated oils.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; important health concerns get overlooked when we focus &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>exclusively on the low-fat versus low-carb question.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;low-carbohydrate diets lead to signiicant and sustained &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>weight loss.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; processed foods can lead to many adverse health problems </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>including heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and obesity.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Every year, Americans use over one billion sharp objects to admin-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ister healthcare in their homes. These sharp objects include lancets, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>needles, and syringes. If not disposed of in puncture-resistant con-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tainers, they can injure sanitation workers. Sharp objects should be </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>disposed of in hard plastic or metal containers with secure lids. The </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>containers should be clearly marked and be puncture resistant.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 134. &nbsp; &nbsp;The paragraph best supports the idea that sanitation workers can </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; do not place sharp objects in puncture-resistant containers.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; come in contact with sharp objects that have not been placed in </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Litigation is not always the only or best way to resolve conlicts. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Mediation offers an alternative approach and it is one that can be </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>quite eficient and successful. Mediation can be faster, less expensive, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and can lead to creative solutions not always possible in a court of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>law. Additionally, mediation focuses on mutually acceptable solu-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tions, rather than on winning or losing.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 135. &nbsp; &nbsp;This paragraph best supports the idea that</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; &nbsp;there is too much reliance on litigation in our society.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; litigation is expensive, slow, and limited by its reliance on fol-</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>More and more ofice workers telecommute from ofices in their </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Many animals hibernate during parts of the year, entering a state that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>is similar to a very deep sleep. But hibernation is more than simply </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a deep sleep. The animal’s body temperature drops well below its </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>normal range, the animal does not wake up for a long period of time, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and its metabolism slows to the point that the animal does not need </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to eat or relieve itself during that period.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>In order to prepare for hibernation, the animal must build up </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>its body weight and increase its body fat. This is important, since </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the animal will be living off its own body fat during the months of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>hibernation. Of course, once the period of hibernation is over, the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>animal “wakes up” to ind itself slim and trim once again!</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Patrick Henry is considered one of the great patriots of America’s </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>The competitive civil-service system is designed to give candidates </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>fair and equal treatment and to ensure that federal applicants are </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; medical resources in emerging nations have diminished in the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>past few years.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; not enough doctors give time and money to those in need of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>medical care.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; many people who live in emerging nations are not receiving </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Knitting has made a major comeback. People are knitting on college </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>campuses, in coffee shops, and in small knitting groups throughout </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the United States. New knitting stores, many with cafes, are popping </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>up all over, and there are more knitting books and magazines being </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>published than ever before. And not all of these knitters are women: </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>As knitting continues to surge in popularity, men are picking up knit-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ting needles in record numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;149. &nbsp; &nbsp;The paragraph best supports the statement that</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; &nbsp;joining a knitting group is a great way to make new friends.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; some people knit because it helps them relax and release stress.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; &nbsp;today’s knitter is not the stereotypical grandmother in a rocking </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Everyone is sensitive to extreme weather conditions. But with age, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the body may become less able to respond to long exposure to very </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>hot or very cold temperatures. Some older people might develop </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>hypothermia when exposed to cold weather. Hypothermia is a drop </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in internal body temperature, which can be fatal if not detected and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>treated.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;150. &nbsp; &nbsp;The paragraph best supports the statement that</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; &nbsp;cold weather is more dangerous for older people than warm </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>weather.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; hypothermia is a condition that only affects older people.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; older people who live in warm climates &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>are healthier than older people who live in cold climates.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; an older person is more susceptible to hypothermia than a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>younger person.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Whether you can accomplish a speciic goal or meet a speciic dead-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>line depends irst on how much time you need to get the job done. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>What should you do when the demands of the job exceed the time </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>you have available? The best approach is to divide the project into </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>smaller pieces. Different goals will have to be divided in different </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ways, but one seemingly unrealistic goal can often be accomplished </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>by working on several smaller, more reasonable goals.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 151. &nbsp; &nbsp;The main idea of the passage is that</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; jobs often remain only partially completed because of lack of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>time.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; the best way to complete projects is to make sure your goals are </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>achievable.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; the best way to tackle a large project is to separate it into </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>smaller parts.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; the best approach to a demanding job is to delegate responsibility.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Health clubs have undergone a major transformation that can be </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>described in three words: mind, body, and spirit. Loud, fast, heart-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>thumping aerobics has been replaced by the hushed tones of yoga </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and the controlled movements of Pilates. The clubs are responding </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to the needs of their customers who are increasingly looking for a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>retreat from their hectic lifestyles and a way to ind a healthy balance </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in their lives by nurturing their whole selves. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;152. &nbsp; &nbsp;The main idea of the paragraph is that</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; &nbsp;exercise is less important now than it once was.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; health clubs are much less popular now than they were &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ten years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; &nbsp;many health clubs will go out of business because of the decline </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in traditional exercise.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; people’s desire to nurture all aspects of themselves has contrib-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>uted to big changes for health clubs.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>For most judges, sentencing a person who has been convicted of a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>crime is a dificult decision. In the majority of jurisdictions through-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>out the country, &nbsp;judges have few sentencing options from which to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>choose. Generally, their options are conined to a ine, probation, or </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>incarceration. Crimes, however, cover a wide spectrum of criminal </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>behavior and motivation, and a wide variety of sanctions should be </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>available.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 153. &nbsp; &nbsp;The main idea of the paragraph is that</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; there should be laws that dictate which sentence a judge should </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>hand down.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; someone other than a judge should be allowed to sentence a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>criminal.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; judges should be given more sentencing options from which to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>choose.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; more money should be spent on the criminal justice system.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Before you begin to compose a business letter, sit down and think </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>about your purpose in writing the letter. Do you want to request </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>information, order a product, register a complaint, or apply for </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>something? Do some brainstorming and gather information before </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>you begin writing. Always keep your objective in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 154. &nbsp; &nbsp;The main idea of the passage is that</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; planning is an important part of writing a business letter.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; business letters are frequently complaint letters.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; brainstorming and writing take approximately equal amounts of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>time.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; many people fail to plan ahead when they are writing a business </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>letter.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Keeping busy at important tasks is much more motivating than hav-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ing too little to do. Today’s employees are not afraid of responsibil-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ity. Most people are willing to take on extra responsibility in order </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to have more variety in their positions. In addition, along with that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>responsibility should come more authority to independently carry </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>out some important tasks.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 155. &nbsp; &nbsp;The main idea of the paragraph is that</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; variety and independence on the job increase employee motiva-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tion.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; to avoid boredom, many people do more work than their jobs </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>require of them.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; today’s employees are demanding more independence than ever </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Managing job and family is not simple. Both commitments make </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>strong demands on people and are sometimes in direct opposition </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to each other. Saying yes to one means saying no to the other, and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>stress can often result. Being realistic and creating a balance in life </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>can help set priorities.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 156. &nbsp; &nbsp;The main idea of the paragraph is that</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; most family responsibilities cause stress at home and at work.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; because it pays the bills, a job must take priority over other </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>commitments.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; it is important to have a balance between job and family respon-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sibilities.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; because they are so important, family duties must take priority </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>over the job.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Women business owners are critically important to the American econ-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>omy, yet women still face unique obstacles in the business world. The &nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>U.S. Small Business Administration offers a variety of programs and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>services to help women-owned businesses succeed and to advocate </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>for women entrepreneurs.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;157. &nbsp; &nbsp;This paragraph best supports the statement that women business </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>owners</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; &nbsp;have more success in the United States than in other countries.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; cannot succeed without outside help.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; &nbsp;may ind the Small Business Administration a useful resource.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Passages in this section can have one to six questions following. You must </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>respond accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Use of electronic mail (e-mail) has been widespread for more than </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a decade. E-mail simpliies the low of ideas, connects people from </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>distant ofices, eliminates the need for meetings, and often boosts </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>productivity. However, e-mail should be carefully managed to avoid </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>unclear and inappropriate communication. E-mail messages should </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>be concise and limited to one topic. When complex issues need to be </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>addressed, phone calls are still best.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;158. &nbsp; &nbsp;The main idea of the paragraph is that e-mail</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; is not always the easiest way to connect people from distant </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ofices.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; has changed considerably since it irst began a decade ago.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; causes people to be unproductive when it is used incorrectly.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; is effective for certain kinds of messages but only if managed </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>wisely.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 159. &nbsp; &nbsp;Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>passage?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; Appropriate Use of E-Mail</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; E-Mail’s Popularity</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; E-Mail: The Ideal Form of Communication</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; Why Phone Calls Are Better Than E-Mail</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Native American art often incorporates a language of abstract visual </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>symbols. The artist gives a poetic message to the viewer, communi-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>cating the beauty of an idea, either by using religious symbols or a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>design from nature such as rain on leaves or sunshine on water. The </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>idea communicated may even be purely whimsical, in which case the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>artist might start out with symbols developed from a bird’s tracks or </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a child’s toy.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 160. &nbsp; &nbsp;The main idea of the passage is that Native American art</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; is purely poetic and dreamlike.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; is usually abstract, although it can also be poetic and beautiful.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; communicates the beauty of ideas through the use of symbols.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; is sometimes purely whimsical.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Something that is clearly stated in a passage. For example, “John </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>is not in the ofice because he is late for work.”</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>This &nbsp; explicitly &nbsp; states why John is not in the ofice—because he is late.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>In criminal cases, the availability of readable ingerprints is often </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>critical in establishing evidence of a major crime. It is necessary, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>therefore, to follow proper procedures when taking ingerprints. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>In major cases, prints should be obtained from all persons who may </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>have touched areas associated with a crime scene, for elimination </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 161. &nbsp; &nbsp;The main idea of the paragraph is that</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; because ingerprints are so important in many cases, it is impor-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tant to follow the correct course in taking them.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; all ingerprints found at a crime scene should be taken and thor-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>oughly investigated.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; if the incorrect procedure is followed in gathering ingerprints, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the ones taken may be useless.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; the irst step in investigating ingerprints is to eliminate those of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>non-suspects.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 162. &nbsp; &nbsp;The paragraph best supports the statement that</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; no crimes can be solved without readable ingerprints.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; all persons who have touched an area in a crime scene are suspects.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; all ingerprints found at a crime scene are used in court as &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; all persons who have touched a crime-scene area should be &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>The city will be enforcing winter parking rules from December 1 </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>This includes alternate-side parking regulations, as well as tow-away </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>zones and handicap exceptions.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Cars are to be parked on the south and east sides of streets </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>sides of streets between midnight and 8 &nbsp; a.m. &nbsp; This is to permit snow </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>plows and emergency vehicles access to all neighborhoods, as well as </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to keep rush-hour trafic to a minimum.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Vehicles that do not follow these guidelines will be towed at </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; They prevent excessive trafic.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; It’s good for the cars to be moved frequently in cold weather.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>homeopathy, massage therapy, yoga, and acupuncture, hold increas-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ing appeal for Americans. In fact, according to one estimate, 42% of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Americans have used alternative therapies. In all age groups, the use </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of unconventional healthcare practices has steadily increased in the </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>before 1945 are the least likely to turn to these therapies.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Why have so many patients turned to alternative therapies? </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Many are frustrated by the time constraints of managed care and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>alienated by conventional medicine’s focus on technology. Others feel </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>that a holistic approach to healthcare better relects their beliefs and </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Some alternative therapies have even crossed the line into main-</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>and eficacy. For example, physicians may currently prescribe acu-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>puncture for pain management or to control the nausea associated </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>with chemotherapy. Additionally, many U.S. medical schools teach </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>courses in alternative therapies, and many health insurance compa-</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;166. &nbsp; &nbsp;What is the main idea of this passage?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; &nbsp;Alternative medicine is now a big business in the United States </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>with more Americans seeking it out than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; Today, it is not unusual for mainstream doctors to incorporate </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>alternative therapies into their practice. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; &nbsp;Over the last few decades, alternative medicine has become </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>more popular, accepted, and practiced in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; People are tired of conventional medicine’s focus on technology.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;167. &nbsp; &nbsp;According to the passage, which practice would not be deined as </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>alternative medicine?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; &nbsp;pain management</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;168. &nbsp; &nbsp;Based on the information given, what kind of person would be </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>least likely to seek out alternative medical treatment?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; &nbsp;a senior citizen suffering from chemotherapy-induced nausea</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; a young woman suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; &nbsp;a 45-year-old man who believes that his body and mind must be </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>treated together.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; a 25-year-old track star with chronic back pain</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;169. &nbsp; &nbsp;The passage indicates that alternative treatments are increasingly </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>being used by mainstream medical professionals because</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; &nbsp;more and more Americans are demanding alternative therapies.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; healthcare insurance companies are now providing some ben-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>eits for alternative medical treatments.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; &nbsp;they are frustrated by the time constraints of managed care.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; scientiic studies are becoming available that prove their effec-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tiveness and safety.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The irst murder ever committed in the United States occurred in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>September 1630, shortly after the Pilgrims arrived in Massachusetts. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>John Billington was the father of two sons, one of the irst to settle </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in the new Plymouth Colony near what is today Boston, and one of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the people who signed the Maylower Compact—and he was also the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>colony’s irst murderer.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Billington, in fact, was the irst person to commit any crime </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in the colony, as far as we know today. He was also the irst to be </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>executed by the state in the New World. Billington’s crime was to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>shoot a man named John Newcomen, for reasons which are lost to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>history.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>But Billington’s problems had not begun on the soil of North </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>America. He and his sons had nearly caused a mutiny aboard the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Maylower during the arduous trip across the ocean. One of his </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sons, in fact, ired his gun aboard the Maylower—near an open keg </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of gunpowder! The lash from the gun could easily have ignited the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>powder, which would probably have sunk the ship.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Once &nbsp;in &nbsp;Plymouth &nbsp;Colony, &nbsp;Billington’s &nbsp;behavior &nbsp;did &nbsp;not </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>improve. He refused to serve any form of military duty under the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>leadership of Miles Standish, a duty that was seen by the colonists as </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>part of every man’s responsibilities in the New World. He was later </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>implicated in a plot to overthrow the entire leadership of Plymouth </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>him go free. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>In the end, Billington’s rebellious and angry nature caught up </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>with him. He was found guilty of the murder of John Newcomen, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and died in disgrace on the gallows.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 170. &nbsp; &nbsp;Based on the information in the passage, which of the following </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>to the passage?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; He had two sons.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; He served in the military under Miles Standish.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; He tried to lead a mutiny.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; He attempted to overthrow the government.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 172. &nbsp; &nbsp;The nearest meaning of the underlined word &nbsp; arduous &nbsp;, as used in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the passage, is</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; dificult.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; simple.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; long.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; stormy.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 173. &nbsp; &nbsp;Why didn’t the leaders of Plymouth Colony punish Billington for </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>rebelling against their authority?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; He was not guilty.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; Billington was Miles Standish’s nephew.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; He had two sons who needed him.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; They didn’t have enough evidence.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Have you ever heard someone sing, “Happy birthday to you . . . </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>happy birthday to you . . .”? If so, you are hardly alone—millions </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of people sing that song every year, and the tune is one of the most </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>familiar of any song in North America.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Ironically, it is not known who wrote it! The tune was written by </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>two sisters, Patty and Mildred Hill, who were school teachers in the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>late 19th century. But their song had different words; instead of “happy </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>birthday to you,” the song ran “good morning to all.” The two sisters </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>would sing this ditty to their students each morning as school began.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>In 1924, the tune was published in a song book, which added </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the “happy birthday” lyrics as verse two. Today, the second verse of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>that song has become one of the best known tunes in the world—and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>nobody knows who wrote the words!</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 175. &nbsp; &nbsp;According to the passage, who wrote the tune to “Happy Birthday”?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; two priests</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; Irving Berlin</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; Patty and Mildred Hill</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; It is not known.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 176. &nbsp; &nbsp;Why is it ironic that the author of the words to “Happy Birthday” </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>is not known?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; because almost everyone knows the song</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; because it shows how unjust life can be</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; because of modern copyright laws</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; because it was published in 1924</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp;177. &nbsp; &nbsp;The underlined word &nbsp; ditty &nbsp;, as used in the passage, most nearly means</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; silly.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; shoe.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; lower.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; short song.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 178. &nbsp; &nbsp;What happened in 1924 to make “Happy Birthday” famous?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; Nothing signiicant happened.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; Hitler came to power in Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; The authors of the tune passed away.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; The tune was published in a song book with the words as a &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Dogs and cats should never be permitted to eat chocolate, because </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>chocolate works like a poison in their bodies. Chocolate contains a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>chemical called theobromine, which is similar to caffeine. Human </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>bodies are able to process the theobromine without any ill side </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>effects, but dogs and cats cannot. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Different types of chocolate contain different amounts of theo-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>bromine. It would take 20 ounces of milk chocolate to kill a 20-pound </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>dog, but only two ounces of baker’s chocolate or six ounces of semi-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sweet chocolate. The amounts, of course, are much smaller for a cat, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>whose body weight is typically less than that of a dog.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Most cats are not naturally attracted to eating chocolate, but </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>many dogs are. Dogs by nature will sample nearly anything that they </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>see their masters eating, so pet owners must take care to keep all </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>chocolate products well out of reach of their dogs and cats.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 179. &nbsp; &nbsp;According to the passage, why is chocolate poisonous for dogs &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and cats?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; It contains caffeine.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; Chocolate is made from processed cocoa.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; It gets stuck in their intestines.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; They cannot process theobromine.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 180. &nbsp; &nbsp;How much milk chocolate would be poisonous to a cat, according </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to the passage?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; substantially less than 20 ounces</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; substantially more than 20 ounces</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; approximately one pound</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; half a Hershey bar</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 181. &nbsp; &nbsp;Why might a dog eat chocolate, according to the passage?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; Because it tastes good.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; Dogs won’t eat chocolate.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; They can smell the theobromine.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; Dogs like to imitate their owners.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>this sickly child later won fame as a political leader, a Rough Rider, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and a hero of the common people. To conquer his handicaps, Teddy </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>trained in a gym and became a lightweight boxer at Harvard. Out </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>west, he hunted buffalo and ran a cattle ranch. Back east, he became a </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>McKinley’s assistant Navy secretary during the Spanish-American </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>War. &nbsp;Also, he led a charge of cavalry Rough Riders up San Juan Hill </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in Cuba. After achieving fame, he became governor of New York and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>went on to become the vice president.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>When McKinley was assassinated, Theodore Roosevelt became </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the youngest president at age 42. He is famous for his motto, “Speak </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>softly and carry a big stick.” Roosevelt battled for meat inspection </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and pure-food laws. Also, he wanted to save the forests and break the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>grip that big business had on steel and oil. Roosevelt persuaded the </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Daylilies are a beautiful perennial lower that can brighten up any </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>yard or landscape. They are tolerant of drought and looding, immune </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to heat stress, and grow well in full sun or light shade. They are the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>perfect choice for just about any soil or climate condition.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Different varieties of daylilies can be in bloom from late spring </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>until autumn. Individual lowers last only one day, but each plant </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>ing period. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Daylilies grow best in soil that is slightly acidic, and they prefer </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>either direct sunshine or light shade. The best time to plant them is </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in the early fall or early spring, but they are hardy enough to endure </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>planting or transplanting at almost any time of year. They should be </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Indians inhabited all the islands of the West Indies and were a peace-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ful people living under the guidance of their chiefs. Three hundred </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>years after the Arawaks irst arrived on St. Maarten, in the 1300s, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>they were defeated and forced to abandon the island by a hostile tribe </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of Indians originating in South America. This new tribe was called </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the Carib. The Caribbean Sea was named after them. Unlike the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Arawaks, they had no permanent chiefs or leaders, except in times </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of strife. And they were extremely warlike. Worse, they were can-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>nibalistic, eating the enemy warriors they captured. In fact, the very </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>word &nbsp; cannibal &nbsp; comes from the Spanish name for the Carib Indians. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The Spanish arrived in the ifteenth century and, unfortunately, they </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>carried diseases to which the Indians had no immunity. Many Indians </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>A metaphor is a poetic device that deals with comparison. It compares </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>similar qualities of two dissimilar objects. With a simple metaphor, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>one object becomes the other: &nbsp; Love is a rose &nbsp;. Although this does not </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sound like a particularly rich image, a metaphor can communicate </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>so much about a particular image that poets use them more than any </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>other type of igurative language. The reason for this is that poets </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>compose their poetry to express what they are experiencing emotion-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ally at that moment. Consequently, what the poet imagines love to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>be may or may not be our perception of love. Therefore, the poet’s </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>job is to enable us to &nbsp; experience &nbsp; it, to feel it the same way that the poet </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>does. We should be able to nod in agreement and say, “Yes, that’s it! </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>I understand precisely where this person is coming from.”</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Let’s analyze this remarkably unsophisticated metaphor con-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>cerning love and the rose to see what it offers. Because the poet uses </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a comparison with a rose, irst we must examine the characteristics </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of that lower. A rose is spectacular in its beauty, its petals are velvety </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>soft, and its aroma is soothing and pleasing. It’s possible to say that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a rose is actually a veritable feast to the senses: the visual, the tactile, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and the aural [more commonly known as the senses of sight, touch, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and sound]. The rose’s appearance seems to border on perfection, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>each petal seemingly symmetrical in form. Isn’t this the way one’s </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>love should be? A loved one should be a delight to one’s senses and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>seem perfect. However, there is another dimension added to the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>comparison by using a rose. Roses have thorns. This is the compre-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>hensive image the poet wants to communicate; otherwise, a daisy or </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a mum would have been presented to the audience as the ultimate </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>representation of love—but the poet didn’t, instead conveying the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>idea that roses can be treacherous. So can love, the metaphor tells </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>us. When one reaches out with absolute trust to touch the object of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>his or her affection, ouch, a thorn can cause great harm! “Be care-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ful,” the metaphor admonishes: Love is a feast to the senses, but it </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp;= Page 86 =</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>can overwhelm us, and it can also hurt us. It can prick us and cause </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>acute suffering. This is the poet’s perception of love—an admonition. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>What is the point? Just this: It took almost 14 sentences to clarify </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>what a simple metaphor communicates in only ive words! &nbsp; That &nbsp; is the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>artistry and the joy of the simple metaphor.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;196. &nbsp; &nbsp;The main idea of this passage is</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; poetic devices are necessary for poets.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; poetry must never cater to the senses.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; always use words that create one speciic image.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; the metaphor is a great poetic device.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 197. &nbsp; &nbsp;It can be inferred that a metaphor is</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; a type of igurative language.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; the only poetic device.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; not precise enough.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; a type of lower in a poem.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 198. &nbsp; &nbsp;According to the passage, thorns</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; protect the rose from harm.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; reduce the ability to love another.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; add a new element to the image of love.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; are just more images to compare to a rose.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 199. &nbsp; &nbsp;It can be inferred that the true meaning of the &nbsp; love is a rose &nbsp; meta-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>phor is that</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; love is a true joy.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; love comes only once in a lifetime.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; love is never permanent.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; love is a combination of good and bad experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 200. &nbsp; &nbsp;According to the passage, the poet’s intention is</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; to release anger.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; to announce heartache.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; to enable you to experience the poet’s point of view.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; to reward the senses.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>The composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s remarkable musical tal-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ent was apparent even before most children can sing a simple nursery </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>rhyme. Wolfgang’s older sister Maria Anna (who the family called </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Nannerl) was learning the clavier, an early keyboard instrument, when &nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>her three-year-old brother took an interest in playing. As Nannerl </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>later recalled, Wolfgang “often spent much time at the clavier picking </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>out thirds, which he was always striking, and his pleasure showed that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>it sounded good.” Their father Leopold, an assistant concertmaster at &nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the Salzburg Court, recognized his children’s unique gifts and soon </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>devoted himself to their musical education.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Born in Salzburg, Austria, on January 27, 1756, Wolfgang had </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>composed his irst original work by age ive. Leopold planned to take </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Nannerl and Wolfgang on tour to play before the European courts. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Their irst venture was to nearby Munich where the children played </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>for Maximillian III Joseph, elector of Bavaria. Leopold soon set his </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sights on the capital of the Hapsburg Empire, Vienna. On their way </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to Vienna, the family stopped in Linz, where Wolfgang gave his </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>irst public concert. By this time, Wolfgang was not only a virtuoso </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>harpsichord player, but he had also mastered the violin. The audi-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ence at Linz was stunned by the six-year-old, and word of his genius </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>soon traveled to Vienna. In a much anticipated concert, the Mozart </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>children appeared at the Schonbrunn Palace on October 13, 1762. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>They utterly charmed the emperor and empress.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Following this success, Leopold was inundated with invitations </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>for the children to play, for a fee. Leopold seized the opportunity and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>booked as many concerts as possible at courts throughout Europe. A </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>concert could last three hours, and the children played at least two </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>per a day. Today, Leopold might be considered the worst kind of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>stage parent, but at the time, it was not uncommon for prodigies to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>make extensive concert tours. Even so, it was an exhausting schedule </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>for a child who was just past the age of needing an afternoon nap.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>objects but with how everyone should dispose of sharp objects </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in order to avoid hurting sanitation workers.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 135. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;See the second sentence of the passage. Choices &nbsp;and &nbsp; are not &nbsp; &nbsp;a &nbsp;b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in the passage. Choice &nbsp; might seem attractive, but the passage &nbsp; c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>does not say that mediation is the best way to resolve a conlict, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>simply that it is an alternative way that might prove effective.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;136. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; See the inal sentence of the passage. The other choices might </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>be true but are not in the passage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;137. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; The second sentence speaks of &nbsp; the greater productivity &nbsp; of tele-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>commuters. The other choices may seem attractive on the sur-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>face because they contain words and phrases from the passage, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>but a closer look will show them to be incorrect or absent from </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the passage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 138. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The irst sentence indicates that sushi was once available only in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a handful of eating establishments.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 139. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; Choice &nbsp;may seem attractive at irst, but the passage doesn’t &nbsp; &nbsp;b</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>portant, it simply tells us what the purposes are.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 140. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The second paragraph states that an animal prepares for hiber-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>nation by increasing its body weight and fat. The reader can </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>infer from this that the animal eats more food than usual.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 141. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; The passage states that hibernation is “more than simply a deep </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sleep,” then lists several ways that hibernation differs from </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;143. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The passage is about Patrick Henry, and focuses on his patriotic </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>activities. No other patriot is mentioned, nor is information </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>given about his other speeches or about the Virginia legislature. </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>are refuted in the passage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;148. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;This answer is implied by the statement that redistribution is </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>needed so that people in emerging nations can have proper medi-</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;149. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; This choice is the best answer because the paragraph indicates </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>that the new knitters are of varying ages and are not just wom-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>en. Choices &nbsp;and &nbsp; may be true, but they are not supported by &nbsp; &nbsp;a &nbsp;b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the paragraph. Choice &nbsp; is a prediction that is not made in the &nbsp; d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>paragraph.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>150. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The paragraph speciically states that age makes a person less </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>able to respond to long exposure to very hot or very cold tem-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>peratures. This would mean that older people are more suscep-</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>the information given in the paragraph.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;151. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; The third sentence is the main idea. It is a general idea that an-</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>are not in the passage.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>transformation due to people’s interest in taking care of their </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>minds, bodies, and spirits. Choice &nbsp; is incorrect because the &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>paragraph doesn’t say exercise is less important. It simply says </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;153. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; This choice is closely related to all three sentences of the pas-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sage. Choice &nbsp; is contradicted in the passage. Choices &nbsp; and &nbsp; &nbsp; a &nbsp;b &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>are not in the passage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;154. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; The entire passage relates to this idea. The other ideas are not </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>relected in the passage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;155. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; This is the main idea of the passage because all the sentences </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>relate to it. The other choices may be true but are not relected </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in the passage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;156. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; This idea is expressed in the inal sentence and wraps up the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>passage, speaking of the importance of &nbsp; creating a balance &nbsp;. The </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>other choices are not in the passage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>157. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; The support for choice &nbsp; is given in the second sentence. No &nbsp; c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>support is given for choices &nbsp;and &nbsp;. Choice &nbsp; is incorrect &nbsp; a &nbsp; d &nbsp;b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>because the paragraph states that women business owners face </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>unique obstacles, but it does not say that they absolutely require </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>outside help to succeed, just that it is available.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;158. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;This choice encompasses the main information in the passage. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Choices &nbsp;, &nbsp;, and &nbsp; are not mentioned. &nbsp;a b &nbsp;c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;159. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; The title should express the main idea of the passage. The </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>passage, as a whole, focuses on appropriate and inappropriate </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>uses of e-mail. The other choices address more speciic ideas </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>expressed in the passage but are not its &nbsp; main &nbsp; idea.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;160. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; The irst and second sentences relect this idea. The passage </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>does not say that Native American art is dreamlike (choice &nbsp;). &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Choices &nbsp; and &nbsp; are too limited to be main ideas. &nbsp;b &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;161. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; This idea is expressed in two of the three sentences in the pas-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sage and sums up the overall meaning of the passage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;162. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;This is stated in the inal paragraph. The other choices are not </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>relected in the passage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;163. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; The passage speciically addresses winter parking rules, while </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>none of the other choices is mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;164. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The second paragraph deines which side of the street should be </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>used at speciic times. It states that cars should be parked on the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>west side between midnight and 8 &nbsp;. . &nbsp;a m</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 166. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; The entire passage supports this idea. Choice &nbsp; is incorrect &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>because the business aspect of alternative medicine is not dis-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>cussed in the passage. Choices &nbsp; and &nbsp;relect accurate support- &nbsp;b &nbsp;d </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ing statements that do appear in the passage, but they are not </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>encompassing enough to relect the main idea.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 167. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; Pain management is a generic term and pain management </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>treatment can be alternative or traditional, depending on the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>practitioner. Choices &nbsp;, , and &nbsp;are not correct because they &nbsp; b &nbsp;c &nbsp;d </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>are all mentioned in the passage as being particular alternative </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>medicine practices.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 168. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; The last sentence of the second paragraph clearly states that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>people born before 1945 are the least likely to turn to alterna-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tive therapies.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 169. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The beginning of the last paragraph discusses this scientiic </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>investigation and its role in making alternative treatments more </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>accepted by mainstream medicine. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;170. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The last paragraph of the passage describes Billington as angry </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and rebellious.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;171. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The passage speciically states that Billington refused to serve in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the military. The other choices are all true.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;172. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; The word &nbsp; arduous &nbsp; means “very dificult or dangerous.”</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;173. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The passage states that the leaders lacked enough evidence to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>prove his guilt, so they let him go free. This does not mean that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>he was not guilty, however. The other choices are not stated in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the passage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;174. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; The passage describes Billington as “the Colony’s irst murderer” </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in the irst paragraph. It does address a small bit of Plymouth </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Colony’s history, but that is not the passage’s main purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;175. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; The passage states that the author of the words is unknown, but </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the authors of the tune were the Hill sisters.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;176. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; Something is &nbsp; ironic &nbsp; if the result is the opposite of what one </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>would expect. It is ironic that nobody knows who wrote this </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>song because almost everyone knows the song itself—we would </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>expect that author to be famous, too.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;177. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; The word &nbsp; ditty &nbsp; refers to a short song.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;178. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The passages states that the Hill sisters’ song was published in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>1924, and the words “happy birthday” were added as a second </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>verse.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;179. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The irst paragraph states that chocolate contains theobromine, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>which cats and dogs cannot process. It also says that theobromine </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>is “similar to caffeine,” but &nbsp; not &nbsp; that chocolate &nbsp; contains &nbsp; caffeine.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;180. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; This question requires you to make some inferences. The pas-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sage states that 20 ounces of milk chocolate can kill a 20-pound </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>dog; it also states that cats can be harmed by smaller amounts </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>than dogs. Therefore, a cat could be poisoned by less than 20 </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ounces of milk chocolate.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;181. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The inal paragraph states that dogs like to eat whatever they </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>see their owners eating. This is a form of imitation.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;182. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The passage mentions that humans can eat chocolate safely, but </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>cats and dogs cannot. Therefore, one might apply choice &nbsp; to &nbsp; b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the topic.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;183. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; The examples in this passage are mainly about Roosevelt’s ac-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>complishments.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;184. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; The second sentence of the irst paragraph supports this choice.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;185. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; In the second paragraph, the irst sentence supports this answer.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;186. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; This is the only choice and is stated in paragraph 1.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;187. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The passage does say that daylilies can grow in “just about any </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>soil,” but it says that they grow &nbsp; best &nbsp; in slightly acidic soil.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;188. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The passage does not state how daylilies got their name, but it </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>does state that the blooms last one day. The reader might infer </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>from this that it’s also the reason that they’re called daylilies.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;189. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; The last sentence states that they should be planted “no deeper </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>than one inch.”</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;190. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The word &nbsp; perennial &nbsp; means “on-going, occurring indeinitely, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>year after year.” It also refers to lowers that bloom every year </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>without needing to be replanted.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;191. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;Six thousand years ago &nbsp; must account for over 2,000 years after </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the birth of Christ, and that leaves almost 4,000 years in the &nbsp; b.c &nbsp;. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>era. All other choices are incorrect math.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>192. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp; The Carib were not in any way described as peaceful but rather, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>hostile &nbsp; people. Therefore, this answer is the exception. All other </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>choices are descriptive of the Caribs and are explicit in the passage.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;193. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; The last two lines of the passage directly state what defeated the </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>tioned in the role of conquerors.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;194. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;Strife means &nbsp; war &nbsp;. Choice &nbsp; refers to the products one can buy &nbsp; c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>on the modern St. Maarten. Choice &nbsp; makes no sense since the &nbsp; d</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Choice &nbsp; is not mentioned in conjunction with being warlike or &nbsp; a</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Choices &nbsp; and &nbsp; have no support in the passage. Choice &nbsp; is &nbsp; b &nbsp;d &nbsp;a</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>conjunction with the Indians.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;196. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The idea of the passage is to convince the reader that the meta-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>phor is a wonderful poetic device. None of the other choices are </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>approached in the passage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;197. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; The irst paragraph clearly states that poets use metaphors </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>more than any other type of igurative language, thereby infer-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ring that a metaphor is a type of igurative language. Choice &nbsp; &nbsp; b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>is incorrect since the phrase &nbsp; other type of igurative language &nbsp; is </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>clearly stated. Choice &nbsp; is not supported in the passage. Choice &nbsp; c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d &nbsp; is incorrect; review the deinition of a metaphor in the irst </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;198. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; This detail is presented in the second paragraph. This links </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>thorns with the idea of adding another dimension to the image of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>love. Choices &nbsp; and &nbsp; are not supported in the passage. Choice &nbsp; a &nbsp;b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d &nbsp; is incorrect because thorns are not being compared to a rose.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;199. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The explanation of the line details how love can be wonderful </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and yet, with the introduction of the thorn imagery, it also pres-</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 201. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; This title most nearly captures the main idea of the passage and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the author’s purpose in writing the piece. The other choices </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>either are not mentioned or are secondary ideas in the passage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 202. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; The passage clearly states that Wolfgang took an interest in the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>clavier when his sister was learning to play the instrument.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 203. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;In the second paragraph, the passage states that Wolfgang’s irst </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>public &nbsp; appearance was at Linz and that after this concert, word </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of his genius traveled to Vienna. This paragraph also states that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Vienna was the &nbsp; capital &nbsp; of the Hapsburg Empire.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 204. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The passage does not say anything about Wolfgang preferring </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>one instrument to another.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 205. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The third paragraph states that at the time, it was not uncom-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>mon for child prodigies to have extensive concert tours. The </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>other choices are not supported by the information given in the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>passage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 206. &nbsp; &nbsp;a. &nbsp; &nbsp; The main point of the passage is to describe Mozart’s experi-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ences as a child prodigy, or a highly talented child. Choices &nbsp;, &nbsp;, &nbsp; b c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and &nbsp; are not mentioned in the paragraph. &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;207. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; The titles in choices &nbsp;, , and &nbsp; all imply that the passage will &nbsp; a &nbsp;b &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>provide information, which it does not. Choice &nbsp; is the most ac- &nbsp;c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>curate choice because the passage deals mainly with remember-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ing the fair.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;208. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; Sentence 1 (choice &nbsp;) contains the phrase &nbsp; a &nbsp;should have been a colos-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sal failure &nbsp;, which is an opinion of the author. The other choices </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>are sentences that provide factual information about Woodstock.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;209. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; The sentence preceding and leading into sentence 3 speaks of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the very brief time—a month—that the organizers of the fair </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>had to ind a new site and get information out. Choices &nbsp; and &nbsp; &nbsp; b &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>are incorrect because they could not have been known about at </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the time the fair was moved. Choice &nbsp; is incorrect because there &nbsp; c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>is no indication in the passage that New York oficials tried to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>stop the fair.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Passages</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Fiction is a piece &nbsp; of writing that tells a story that didn’t really happen </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in real life—it’s &nbsp; ictional &nbsp;, made up by the author. &nbsp; Noniction &nbsp;, on the other </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>hand, refers to a piece of writing about something that &nbsp; did &nbsp; happen. History </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>books and biographies are noniction because they address actual events </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and real people. Finally, &nbsp; informational &nbsp; writing refers to passages whose </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>purpose is to inform the reader about something. Informational passages </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>contain facts and igures, and include newspaper articles, business memos, </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>In this section, you will be dealing with noniction and information pas- &nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sages, such as the type you might ind in a textbook. Mastering these types of </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>found in standardized tests. These passages are not necessarily more dificult </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>than the ones you’ve already covered in the earlier chapters of this book. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>However, they do call more heavily for the special skill of making inferences, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of identifying &nbsp; implicit, &nbsp; as opposed to &nbsp; explicit &nbsp;, ideas stated in the text.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Remember what you’ve learned so far. Look at structure. Look for the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>main idea of the passage. Consider the purpose for which the passage </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>was written. What clues can you deduce from the writing style about the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>author’s attitude toward the subject? Is the attitude positive? Negative? </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Objective? Try to pick out individual words that further each writer’s </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>notes on important points. Active reading techniques like these will keep </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>The answers to this section begin on page 118.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The coconut is an unusual food for many reasons. It is technically </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a seed, produced by the coconut palm tree, and as such is one of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the largest edible seeds produced by any plant. Its unusual contents </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>also make it unique in the seed world—the interior consists of both </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>“meat” and “water.” The meat is the white pith with which we are all </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>familiar, as it is used extensively for cooking and lavorings; the coco-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>nut water is a white liquid that is very sweet and thirst-quenching.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Portuguese explorers gave the nut its name in the 15th century, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>referring to it as coco, meaning “ghost” in their language. The three </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>dimples and the hairy texture reminded them of a ghost’s face, and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the tree has retained that name ever since. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The coconut has many varied uses. It is used to make marga-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>rine, as well as various cooking oils, and these cooking oils are used </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>by fast-food restaurants around the world to make such diet staples </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>as French fries. The coconut luid is a favorite drink in hot climates, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>providing a cool and refreshing beverage right off the tree. This </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>water is also used by manufacturers of various sports drinks because </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of its isotonic electrolyte properties. Even the shell itself has many </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>uses, including cattle food and fertilizer.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Yet the coconut is also useful in many ways that have nothing </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to do with food. Coconut oil is used for cosmetics, medicines, and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>can even be used in place of diesel fuel. Dried coconut shells are used </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in many countries as a tool, such as a buffer for shining wood loors. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The shells are also used for shirt buttons, and are commonly found </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>and bird houses!</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>And all these are only some of the uses found for the coconut </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>fruit. The coconut palm tree, which produces the nut, also produces </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>countless useful items. It’s no wonder that the coconut palm has been </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>called “the tree of life.”</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Saving energy means saving money. Homeowners and renters know </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>this basic fact, but they often don’t know what kinds of adjustments they </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>can make in their homes and apartments that will result in savings.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>For those willing to spend some time and money to reap long-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>term energy savings, an energy audit is the way to go. An energy audi-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tor will come into your home and assess its energy eficiency. The </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>auditor will pinpoint areas of your home that use the most energy and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>offer solutions to lower your energy use and costs. Trained energy </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>auditors know what to look for and can locate a variety of laws that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>may be resulting in energy ineficiency, including inadequate insula-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tion, construction laws, and uneven heat distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>There are quicker and less costly measures that can be taken as </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>well. One way to save money is to replace incandescent lights with </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>luorescents. This can result in a savings of more than 50% on your </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>monthly lighting costs.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>When it’s time to replace old appliances, it’s wise to spend a bit </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>more for an energy-eficient model, and be sure that you are taking </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>advantage of energy-saving settings already on your current refrig-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>erator, dishwasher, washing machine, or dryer.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Windows provide another opportunity to cut your energy costs. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Caulk old windows that might be leaky to prevent drafts, and choose </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>double-paned windows if you’re building an addition or replacing </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>old windows.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Most areas of your home or apartment offer opportunities to </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Book clubs are a great way to meet new friends or keep in touch </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>with old ones, while keeping up on your reading and participating in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>lively and intellectually stimulating discussions. If you’re interested </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in starting a book club, you should consider the following options </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and recommendations.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The irst thing you’ll need are members. Before recruiting, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>think carefully about how many people you want to participate and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>also what the club’s focus will be. For example, some book clubs focus </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>exclusively on iction, others read noniction. Some are even more </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>speciic, focusing only on a particular genre such as mysteries, science </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>iction, or romance. Others have a more lexible and open focus. All </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of these possibilities can make for a great club, but it is important to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>decide on a focus at the outset so the guidelines will be clear to the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>group and prospective member.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>After setting the basic parameters, recruitment can begin. Notify </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>friends and family, advertise in the local newspaper, and hang lyers </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>on bulletin boards in local stores, colleges, libraries, and bookstores. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>When enough people express interest, schedule a kick-off meeting </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>during which decisions will be made about speciic guidelines that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>will ensure the club runs smoothly. This meeting will need to estab-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>lish where the group will meet (rotating homes or a public venue </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>such as a library or coffee shop); how often the group will meet, and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>on what day of the week and at what time; how long the meetings </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>will be; how books will be chosen and by whom; who will lead the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>group (if anyone); and whether refreshments will be served and if so, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>who will supply them. By the end of this meeting, these guidelines </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>should be set and a book selection and date for the irst oficial meet-</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>The situation resulted in the formation of an employee task force, </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Mental and physical health professionals may consider referring cli-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ents and patients to a music therapist for a number of reasons. It </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>seems a particularly good choice for the social worker who is coor-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>dinating a client’s case. Music therapists use music to establish a rela-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tionship with the patient and to improve the patient’s health, using </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>highly structured musical interactions. Patients and therapists may </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sing, play instruments, dance, compose, or simply listen to music.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The course of training for music therapists is comprehensive. In </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>addition to formal musical and therapy training, music therapists are </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>taught to discern what kinds of interventions will be most beneicial </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>for each individual patient. Because each patient is different and has </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>different goals, the music therapist must be able to understand the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>patient’s situation and choose the music and activities that will do the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>most toward helping the patient achieve his or her goals. The refer-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ring social worker can help this process by clearly communicating </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>each client’s history.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Although patients may develop their musical skills, that is not </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the main goal of music therapy. Any client who needs particular work </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>on communication or on academic, emotional, and social skills, and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>who is not responding to traditional therapy, is an excellent candidate </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>When painting wood, the most important step is to thoroughly sand </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the wood to a smooth inish. All burrs and rough spots must be </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>cleaning the wood, one should give it two coats of primer. This neu-</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>see thousands of twinkling stars in the inky blackness, one now sees </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>little more than the yellow glare of urban sky-glow. When we lose </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Worldwide illiteracy rates have consistently declined in the last </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>few decades. One of the major reasons for this decline is the sharp </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>increase of literacy rates among young women, which is a result of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>speciic campaigns designed to increase educational opportunities </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>for girls. However, there are still an estimated 771 million illiterate </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>adults in the world, about two-thirds of who are women.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;243. &nbsp; &nbsp;Based on the passage, the author would tend to agree with which </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of the following statements?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; &nbsp;Men and women should have equal access to education.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; Males have a greater need for higher education than women.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; &nbsp;Worldwide, women need medical care more than the ability to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>read.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; It has been proven that women with increased education have </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>fewer children.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Emperor Charlemagne of the Franks was crowned in 800 &nbsp; a.d. &nbsp; The </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Frankish Empire at that time extended over what is now Germany, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Italy, and France. Charlemagne died in 814 &nbsp; a.d. &nbsp;, but his brief reign </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>marked the dawn of a distinctly European culture. The artists and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>thinkers that helped create this European civilization drew on the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ancient texts of the Germanic, Celtic, Greek, Roman, Hebrew, and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Christian worlds. _______________________________________. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Consequently, they were the groundwork for the laws, customs, and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>even attitudes of today’s Europeans.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 244. &nbsp; &nbsp;Which sentence, if inserted into the blank line in the passage, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>would be most consistent with the writer’s purpose and intended </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>audience?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; Cultural traditions function to identify members of a culture to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>one another and, also, to allow the individual to self-identify.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; Many of the traditions of these cultures remained active in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Frankish society for centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; When tradition is lacking or is not honored by the younger </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>generation in a society, there is danger that the culture will be </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>lost.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; It is unnecessary to discuss the origin of these traditions; it will </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>only muddy the water.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 245. &nbsp; &nbsp;Which of the following is the best meaning of the word &nbsp; culture &nbsp; as it </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>is used in the passage?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; the fashionable class</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; a community of interrelated individuals</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; a partnership</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; an organized group with a common goal</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 246. &nbsp; &nbsp;According to the passage, for how many years was Charlemagne </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Emperor of the Franks?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; 14 years</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; 15 years</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>The ilm &nbsp; Lawrence of Arabia &nbsp; may be somewhat dated by modern </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>special-effects standards, but it remains a high-water mark in the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>annals of ilmmaking. Since we’re on the subject of CGI and other </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>computer-generated special effects, Lawrence has none for the sim-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ple reason that it was actually ilmed using real people who really </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>performed the action. The long, slow scenes of camels walking in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the desert may seem dull to the modern animation-jaded viewer, but </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>those willing to pay attention to the underlying themes will be well </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>rewarded by what the movie is saying.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>And it is the theme of &nbsp; Lawrence &nbsp; that really stays with a viewer, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>even today, some 40 years after it was released. That theme is the age-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>old story of hubris—the pride of a man which raises him above his </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>peers, only to dash him on the rocks of self-indulgence by the end. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>We see this tragic foible of mankind worked out fully in the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>character of Lawrence himself, who begins the ilm as a brilliant genius </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>who is eager to get involved in the desert conlicts of World War I. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>His cocky attitude irritates his superiors and amuses the Arabs ighting </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>alongside the British, but his genius for details and strategy soon over-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>come all obstacles. Lawrence’s brilliant victory at the Suez Canal could </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>only have been accomplished by Lawrence, and his own self-sacriice </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and commitment to his followers display the best of his character.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Unfortunately, the baser elements of that character gradually </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>take control as the ilm moves along, and Lawrence slowly declines </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>into a dangerous blend of despair and self-assurance. The problem </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>gradually becomes evident: Lawrence has grown to believe that he is </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>equal to God, the one who both gives life and takes it away again. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;247. &nbsp; &nbsp;What is the central theme of &nbsp; Lawrence of Arabia &nbsp;, according to this </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>passage?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; &nbsp;the importance of the Suez Canal</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; man’s pride will bring about his destruction</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; &nbsp;the Arabian Desert is a hostile environment</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; it is a documentary on World War I</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;248. &nbsp; &nbsp;What is the meaning of the underlined word &nbsp; hubris &nbsp;, as it is used in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the passage?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; &nbsp;a halo</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; death</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;249. &nbsp; &nbsp; You might infer that the author of this passage</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; &nbsp;has traveled in the Middle East.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; does not like the character of Lawrence.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; &nbsp;admires the ilm &nbsp; Lawrence of Arabia &nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; knows nothing about the Suez Canal.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>In 1899, Czar Nicholas II of Russia invited the nations of the world </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to a conference at The Hague. This conference—and a follow-up </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>organized by Theodore Roosevelt in 1907—ushered in a period of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>vigorous growth in international law. This growth was in response to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>several factors, not the least of which was modern warfare’s increas-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ing potential for destruction. The recently concluded Civil War in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the United States made this potential clear.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>During this growth, the subjects of international law were almost </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>exclusively restricted to the relationships that countries had with one </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>another. Issues of trade and warfare dominated both the disputes and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the agreements of the period. ___________, the developments of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>this period paved the way for further expansion of international law, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>which has occurred in the last several years. ________, organizations </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>such as the United Nations and the International Court of Justice </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>are greatly concerned not only with the way countries deal with one </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; It allowed armaments manufacturers to test new weapons.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; It resulted in the suspension of agriculture exports from south-</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>A healthy diet with proper nutrition is essential for maintaining good </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>overall health. Since the discovery of vitamins earlier in this century, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>people have routinely been taking vitamin supplements for this pur-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>pose. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) is a frequently </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>used nutritional standard for maintaining optimal health. The RDA </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>speciies the recommended amount of a number of nutrients for peo-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ple in different age and sex groups. The National Research Council’s </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Committee on Diet and Health has proposed a deinition of the RDA </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to be that amount of a nutrient which meets the needs of 98% of the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>population.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The RDA approach _________________ . First, it is based on </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the assumption that it is possible to accurately deine nutritional </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>requirements for a given group. However, individual nutritional </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>requirements can vary widely within each group. The eficiency with </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>widely. Certain foods when eaten in combination actually prevent </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the absorption of nutrients. For example, spinach combined with </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>milk reduces the amount of calcium available to the body from the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>milk. Also, the RDA approach speciies a different dietary require-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ment for each age and sex; however, it is clearly unrealistic to expect </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a homemaker to prepare a different menu for each family member. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Still, although we cannot rely solely upon RDA to ensure our overall </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 254. &nbsp; &nbsp;With which of the following would the author most likely agree?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; The RDA approach should be replaced by a more realistic </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>nutritional guide.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; The RDA approach should be supplemented with more speciic </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>nutritional guides.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; In spite of its laws, the RDA approach is deinitely the best </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>guide to good nutrition.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; The RDA approach is most suitable for a large family.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Businesses today routinely keep track of large amounts of both inan-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>cial and non-inancial information. Sales departments keep track of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>current and potential customers; marketing departments keep track </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of product details and regional demographics; accounting depart-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ments keep track of inancial data and issue reports. To be useful, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>all this data must be organized into a meaningful and useful system. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Such a system is called a &nbsp; management information system &nbsp;, abbreviated </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>MIS. The inancial hub of the MIS is accounting.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Typically, people think of genius, whether it manifests in Mozart’s </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>composition of symphonies at age ive or Einstein’s discovery of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>relativity, as having a quality not just of the supernatural, but also </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of the eccentric. People see genius as a good abnormality; more-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>over, they think of genius as a completely unpredictable abnormality. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Until recently, psychologists regarded the quirks of genius as too </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>erratic to describe intelligibly; however, Anna Findley’s ground-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>breaking study uncovers predictable patterns in the biographies </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of geniuses. These patterns do not dispel the common belief that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>there is a kind of supernatural intervention in the lives of unusually </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>talented men and women, however, even though they occur with </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>three intensely productive periods in their lives, one of which always </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>O’Connell Street is the main thoroughfare of Dublin City. Although </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>it is not a particularly long street, Dubliners will proudly tell the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>visitor that it is the widest street in all of Europe. This claim usually </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>meets with protests, especially from French tourists, claiming the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Champs Elysees of Paris as Europe’s widest street. But the witty </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Dubliner will not easily relinquish bragging rights and will trump </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the French visitor with a ine distinction: The Champs Elysees is a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>boulevard &nbsp;; O’Connell is a &nbsp; street &nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Divided by several important monuments running the length </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of its center, the street is named for Daniel O’Connell, an Irish </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>patriot. _____________________________. O’Connell stands high </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>above the unhurried crowds of shoppers, business people, and stu-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>dents on a sturdy column, surrounded by four serene angels seated </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>at each corner of the monument’s base. Further up the street is the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>famous General Post Ofice that locals affectionately call the GPO. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>During the 1916 rebellion, the GPO was taken over from British </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>rule and occupied by Irish rebels, sparking weeks of armed combat </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in the city’s center. To this day, the angels of O’Connell’s monument </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>bear the marks of the ighting: One sits reading calmly, apparently </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>soak up the local lavor. Recently relocated to the old market area, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Dilly’s is especially popular for lunch. At the counter, you can place </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>your order for one of Dilly’s three daily lunch specials or one of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>several sandwiches, all at reasonable prices. Once you get your food, </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Restaurant review</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Yesterday, I was exposed to what has been called “a dining experience </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>like no other.” At lunchtime, Dilly’s Deli is so crowded, I wondered </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>when the ire marshal had last visited the establishment. The line snaked </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>out the door to the corner, and by the time I reached the counter, I was </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>freezing. I decided on the hamburger steak special; the other specials </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>being liver and onions or tuna casserole. Each special is offered with </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>two side dishes, but there was no potato salad left and the green beans </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>were cooked nearly beyond recognition. I chose the gelatin of the day </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and what turned out to be the blandest coleslaw I have ever eaten.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>At Dilly’s, you sit at one of four long tables. The couple sitting </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>across from me was having an argument. The truck driver next to me </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>told me more than I wanted to know about highway taxes. After I had </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tasted all of the food on my plate, I rose to leave, whereupon one of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the people working behind the counter yelled at me to clean up after </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>myself. Throwing away that plate of food was the most enjoyable </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>part of dining at Dilly’s.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 266. &nbsp; &nbsp;If you go to lunch at Dilly’s Deli, you could expect to see</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>The Hopkinton Town Council met last night to address the ques-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tion of building a skate-board ramp in Wilcox Park, but the public </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>response segment of the meeting took much longer than anticipated, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and the question had to be shelved until next meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Chairman Mark Santucci opened the loor for public comment </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>soon after the issue was raised, and for the next two hours the public </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>took advantage of the opportunity. An estimated 375 local residents </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>turned out for the meeting, and nearly 200 of those present stepped </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to the microphone to voice their views.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Many residents were vehemently opposed to the proposal to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>build a large skate boarding area in the southeast corner of the park. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The proposed facilities would include a “tunnel,” several ramps, and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a “dish”—all made of cement for use by skate-boarders.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>“The last thing we need in this town,” stated Michael Fritz of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Hopkinton, “is more grafiti. If we put in a skate board park, that’s </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>exactly what we’ll get for our efforts.”</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>A few of those who spoke, however, endorsed the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>“Our kids need fresh air and exercise,” complained Betty Kelly </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of Hopkinton. “They spend too much time as it is playing video </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>games. This would give them someplace to go.”</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The next meeting was scheduled for June 15.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 271. &nbsp; &nbsp;What is the central issue that is causing conlict in Hopkinton, &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>according to this passage?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; the delay in resolving the skate boarding issue</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; whether taxpayers should pay for park improvements</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; the moral implications of skate boarding</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; whether the town should build a skate board park</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 272. &nbsp; &nbsp;What is the central argument of Betty Kelly’s comments?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; Kids need more freedom and less supervision.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; Kids need a place to play outdoors.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>air of our dwellings. Every cleanser releases its own assortment of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>fumes. Some of the chemicals are formaldehyde, chlorine, benzene, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>styrene, etc. Read the labels on many home products, the ingredi-</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>much like allergies. In fact, most people probably dismiss the effects </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of these chemicals simply as a lare up of some allergy or other. The </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>truth is that we are experiencing a syndrome that is called Mul-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tiple Chemical Sensitivity. Now, what has this got to do with green </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>plants? Everything healthy! Research has been conducted with two </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>types of plants that have actually removed much of these harmful </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>chemicals from the air.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The two plants that seem to be the best bet for ridding one’s </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>home of such chemicals are ferns and palms. These plants release </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>moisture as part of photosynthesis and, as they do, pull chemicals </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>from the air into their leaves. Even NASA has conducted some green-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>house experiments for long-term space exploration. Within hours, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>their plants [palms] had removed almost all traces of formaldehyde in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the room. Both species of plants are ancient, dating back more than a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>hundred million years. Another trait they share is that they both live </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>long lives, 100 years or more. This we expect from trees, but ferns </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and palms are plants; plants that can grow to 65 feet in the proper </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>setting! Even their individual leaves live for one to two years [ferns] </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and one to nine years [palms]. Perhaps it is their primal qualities that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>have contributed to their ability to purify their environment.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 275. &nbsp; &nbsp;What is the main idea of the passage?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; Our homes are full of contaminants.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; Our allergies are caused by chemicals found in the home.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; All plants release moisture in the home.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; Certain plants can purify the home of many harmful chemicals.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 276. &nbsp; &nbsp;According to the passage, when a few harmful chemicals combine, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>they can</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Despite their similarities, the pyramids of Egypt and Mesoamerica </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>seem to be unrelated because of distinct differences in the time of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>construction as well as their design and function. Historians have </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>discovered that the construction of the pyramids in Egypt and Meso-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>america are separated by over 2,000 years. The Egyptians used only </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>cut stone quarried many miles away from the pyramid sites—a con-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>struction method that enabled them to construct sturdy buildings </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>that could withstand the test of time.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>On the other hand, the pyramids of Mesoamerica were not built </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to withstand the ravages of time. Rather, the step pyramids rose in </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Egyptians, they used irregular stones.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Also, they did not share the same basic design function. The </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Egyptian pyramids were private tombs meant to separate the pha-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>raoh’s remains from the mainstream of society and protect him for </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp;280. &nbsp; &nbsp;The main idea of this passage is best summed up in which statement?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; Pyramids in Egypt and Mesoamerica are similar.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; Egyptians assisted Mesoamerican pyramid builders.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; Pyramids in Egypt and Mesoamerica have distinct differences.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; Scientists do not know who built the pyramids.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 281. &nbsp; &nbsp;This passage best supports the statement that</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; the Egyptians used stone quarried many miles away from the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>pyramid site.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; the pyramids of Mesoamerica were built to last for eternity.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; the Egyptian pyramids were public tombs.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; the Egyptian and Mesoamerican pyramids were built during the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>same time period.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 282. &nbsp; &nbsp;The passage best supports the statement that</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; Egyptian and Mesoamerican pyramids shared the same design </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>function.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; both pyramids were used as temples of ritual and celebration.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; Egyptian and Mesoamerican pyramids shared the same con-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>struction methods.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; Mesoamerican pyramids were used for ritual and celebration.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 283. &nbsp; &nbsp;The underlined word &nbsp; eternity &nbsp; in the passage most nearly means </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>which of the following?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; for a short time</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; temporary</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Beginning March 1, the company will be instituting a new dress code. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Employees are to be professional in their appearance at all times. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>“Professional attire” is a lexible term to some degree, but the inal </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>judgment shall be left to management in all areas. Some guidelines </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>include the following:</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Men:</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class=rvts6>n</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; Neckties are recommended for all salaried and exempt employ-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ees. Non-exempt and hourly employees may or may not be </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>required to wear neckties, depending upon job duties and the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>discretion of management.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class=rvts6>n</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; Sweaters or sports jackets are not required, but may still be </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>considered appropriate for certain situations, such as meetings </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>with clients. Management retains the option to mandate such </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in certain circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class=rvts6>n</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; Blue jeans are never appropriate, except on certain speciied </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>days—such as “casual Fridays” or “dress-down days,” at the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>discretion of management.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class=rvts6>n</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; Sneakers and running shoes are not appropriate unless the em-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ployee’s duties require excessive walking or stand-up work, or </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>when required by medical or health issues. Management shall </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>retain the right to make speciic exceptions as necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Women:</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class=rvts6>n</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; Pant-suits are acceptable, provided that they retain a profes-</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class=rvts6>n</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; Shorts, “hot pants,” “culottes,” and similar attire is never appro-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>priate. This includes “dress-down days” and other times of casual </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class=rvts6>n</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; Skirts and dresses should be of at least moderate length, reach-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ing the knees. Dresses and skirts above the knees are consid-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ered inappropriate at all times, including “dress-down days” </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>retain the right to make speciic exceptions as necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 284. &nbsp; &nbsp;What is the main idea of this passage?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; Employees must follow orders.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; Management has the inal say.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; Employees must always appear professional.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; Blue jeans are unacceptable in the work place.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 285. &nbsp; &nbsp;The underlined word &nbsp; mandate &nbsp;, as used in the passage, most nearly </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>means</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; to make something optional.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; a common form of ofice communication.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; to enjoy a social outing with friends.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; to make something a requirement.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 286. &nbsp; &nbsp;From this dress code, you could infer that T-shirts are</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; walways appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; acceptable if they have no writing or advertising.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; left up to the discretion of the employee.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; never appropriate.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Answers</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;210. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The word &nbsp; pith &nbsp; means meat or core, and it refers here to the ed-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ible part of the coconut.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;211. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The passage states that Portuguese explorers thought the coco-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>nut resembled a face, because of its three dimples (like eyes and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>mouth) and its hairy texture.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;212. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The passage does touch briely on most of these choices, but the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>main focus is on the many ways that coconut palms are used.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;213. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; The passage details the many valuable uses for the coconut </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>palm, so choice a is best. None of the other choices is implied.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;214. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; All of the choices are included in the passage except helium bal-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>loons, which are not mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;215. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The word &nbsp; staples &nbsp; in this context refers to commonly used items. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The best choice for “diet staples” is &nbsp; foods &nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;216. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The inal paragraph implies that the tree’s many uses and foods </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>earned it the name “tree of life.” None of the other choices is </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>supported by the passage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 217. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;Ideas are listed by topic, but there is some cause and effect as </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>well since the passage explains the reasons for the various steps. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The other choices are incorrect because the passage does not </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>list the ideas in order of importance (hierarchical) or in the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>order in which they have occurred or should occur (chronologi-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>cal). These steps can occur in any order.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 218. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; The passage does say that a homeowner can have an energy </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>audit, but it says nothing about a local energy company pro-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>viding that service. Choice &nbsp; may seem attractive at irst since &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>those speciic igures are not mentioned in the passage, but the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>third paragraph does say that luorescent bulbs can save 50% on </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>lighting costs, and $65 is almost 50% less than $135. Choices &nbsp; b </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and &nbsp; are clearly stated in the passage. &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 219. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; The passage is offering recommendations about the many </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>things homeowners and renters can do to save money and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>energy. The other choices may all be mentioned in the passage, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>but they are too speciic to be the main idea.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 220. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The passage says nothing about an energy auditor actually ix-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ing the laws him- or herself, simply that the auditor will locate </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the laws and offer possible money-saving solutions.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 221. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; The ifth paragraph states that double-paned windows can </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>cut energy costs, so we can infer that this means that they are </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>energy eficient. The other three choices are not stated in the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>passage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;222. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; The passage is organized chronologically. The steps for starting </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a book club are listed in the order in which they should occur.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 223. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; The second sentence of the second paragraph states this clearly.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 224. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;Deciding on the club’s focus—the kinds of books or genre the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>club will read—should be done prior to this meeting and prior </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to recruiting members, according to the second paragraph.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 225. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;This is the only appropriate title. Choice &nbsp; is too speciic, since &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the passage indicates that making new friends is just one com-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ponent of a book club. Choice &nbsp; is incorrect because this pas- &nbsp;c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sage does not contain numbered steps. Choice &nbsp; is too vague, &nbsp; d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and the tone is inappropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 226. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; The passage states this is one possible focus but does not say </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>successful book clubs must focus exclusively on one genre. The </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>other choices are all in the passage. Choice &nbsp; might seem attrac- &nbsp;c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tive at irst, but the passage clearly states that a focus should be </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>chosen, even if that focus is deined as lexible and open.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 227. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The tone and speciicity of the passage infer that a successful </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>book club requires careful planning.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 228. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;This is a listing of reasons why Hartville employees are unhappy </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and went on strike.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 229. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; The second sentence of the second task-force inding states that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Hartville’s equipment does not meet current health and safety </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>standards. Choices &nbsp; and &nbsp; may be attractive at irst, but choice &nbsp; a &nbsp;b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a &nbsp; is incorrect because it doesn’t say the equipment is broken, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>just that it is old and dangerous. Choice &nbsp; is incorrect because &nbsp; b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>computer keyboards are not mentioned, and there is no indica-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tion that computer keyboards are included in the equipment </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>being discussed. </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 230. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The only speciic recommendation in the task-force ind-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ings appears in the second inding regarding equipment in the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>manufacturing department, in the inal sentence.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 231. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The inal inding of the task force states that due to the with-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>holding of information by middle management, upper manage-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ment is unaware of the severity of employee discontent. The </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>other choices are not stated in the passage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 232. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The third task-force inding states that sick and personal day poli-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>cies are unclear, and no outline of an actual policy is provided. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;233. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; Choice c provides the best outline of the passage. The other </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>choices all contain points that are not covered by the passage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;234. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;This passage provides information to social workers about music </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>therapy, as the title in choice &nbsp; indicates. Choice &nbsp; is incorrect &nbsp; b &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>because the irst sentence speaks of mental- and physical-health </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>professionals &nbsp; referring &nbsp; their clients and patients to music thera-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>pists; the second sentence indicates that &nbsp; (meaning a &nbsp; it &nbsp;referral &nbsp;) </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>seems a particularly good choice for the social worker &nbsp;. Choice &nbsp; is &nbsp; c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>possible, but does not summarize the passage as well as choice &nbsp;. &nbsp; b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Choice &nbsp; refers to a topic not covered in the passage. &nbsp;a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;235. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;Although the other choices may be correct, they require </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>knowledge beyond the passage. Based on the information in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the passage, &nbsp; is the best choice. &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;236. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; Based particularly on the last sentence of the passage, &nbsp; is the best &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>choice. The other choices are beyond the scope of the passage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;237. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;In the Northern Hemisphere, June 21 would be summer; how-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ever, according to the passage, it is the beginning of winter in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the Southern Hemisphere.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;238. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;Logically, if June 21 is called the summer solstice in the North-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ern Hemisphere, then that same day would be the winter solstice </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in the Southern Hemisphere.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;239. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;A careful reading of the passage is required for this question, be-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>cause the author does not provide a step-by-step, numbered list </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of instructions. Yet he &nbsp; does &nbsp; give clear instructions on how to paint </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>wood, and the reader must create a step-by-step list in his or her </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>own mind. Choice &nbsp; includes all the steps in the correct order. &nbsp;d</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;241. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;Choice &nbsp; is the most accurate conclusion because the irst sen- &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tence speaks of &nbsp; periods of war &nbsp;. The other choices, whether true </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>or false, are not addressed in the selection.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;242. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;Although the people in the other choices might read this pas-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sage, it is not directed toward scholars (choices &nbsp; and &nbsp;), nor &nbsp; a &nbsp;b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>is there anything in it about operating a loom (choice &nbsp;). The &nbsp; c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>light, informative tone, as well as the subject matter of the </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>243. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; Choices &nbsp;and &nbsp; are beyond the scope of this passage and a &nbsp; &nbsp;c &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>reader would not be able to tell if the author believed them, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>based on the information provided. Choice &nbsp; relects a point of &nbsp; c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>view that would be unlikely for the author based on the con-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tent of this passage, which implies that the author believes that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>women and men have an equal need for education.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;244. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The missing sentence is in a portion of the passage that dis-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>cusses the long-term impacts of the Franks; therefore, &nbsp; is the &nbsp; b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>best choice. Choices &nbsp; and &nbsp; are written in a style appropriate to &nbsp; a &nbsp;c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the passage, but the information is not appropriate. Choice &nbsp; is &nbsp; d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>more informal in style than the rest of the passage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;245. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;Although all of the choices are possible deinitions of &nbsp; culture &nbsp;, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the passage is speaking of a community of interrelated individu-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>als, namely, Europeans.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;246. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; The passage explicitly states that Charlemagne was crowned </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>emperor in 800 and died in 814—a period of 14 years. There-</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>247. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;Man’s pride will bring about his destruction. The author speaks </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>about the pride of Lawrence, explaining how the ilm shows </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Lawrence’s rise and fall.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>248. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The author deines it indirectly in the article by saying that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>hubris is “the pride of a man.”</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>249. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; The author’s tone is very enthusiastic about the movie, and &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>he even refers to it as “a high-water mark in the annals of &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ilmmaking.” </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;250. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The context of the passage indicates that the sentences in ques-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tion are pointing out an unforeseen consequence ( &nbsp;however &nbsp;) and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the current situation ( &nbsp;now &nbsp;). The other choices would result in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>meanings that do not it with the low of information in the rest </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;251. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;Choices &nbsp;, , and &nbsp; are not supported by information in the pas- &nbsp;a &nbsp;b &nbsp;c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sage. Thus, the best choice is &nbsp;. &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;252. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;Choices &nbsp; and &nbsp; are possible deinitions of &nbsp; a &nbsp;c &nbsp;ushered, &nbsp; but do not </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>it in the context of the passage. Choice &nbsp; is an incorrect deini- &nbsp;b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tion. &nbsp; Heralded &nbsp;, choice &nbsp;, is the best deinition in the context. &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;253. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The blank is followed by a discussion of the shortcomings of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the RDA approach. Choice &nbsp; is incorrect because it does not &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>lead into a discussion regarding the RDA approach’s shortcom-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ings. Choice &nbsp; is incorrect because it is contradicted by the inal &nbsp; c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sentence of the passage, which states that the RDA approach </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>remains a &nbsp; useful guide &nbsp;. Choice &nbsp; is incorrect because its casual &nbsp; d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>style is inconsistent with the style used in the rest of the passage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;254. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;Choice &nbsp; is indicated by the inal sentence, which indicates that &nbsp; b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the RDA approach is useful, but has limitations, implying that a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>supplemental guide would be a good thing. Choice &nbsp; is contra- &nbsp;a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>dicted by the inal sentence of the passage. Choice &nbsp; is incorrect &nbsp; c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>because the passage says the RDA approach is a &nbsp; useful guide &nbsp;, but </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>does not say it is the best guide to good nutrition. Choice &nbsp; is &nbsp; d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>contradicted by the next to last sentence of the passage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;255. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The passage contains objective information about accounting </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>such as one might ind in a textbook. There is nothing new or </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>newsworthy in it (choice &nbsp;). The passage does not contain the &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>signiicant amount of personal opinion one might ind in an </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>essay (choice &nbsp;). It does not deal with matters that might involve &nbsp; c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>government (choice &nbsp;). &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;256. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The inal sentence emphasizes the importance of correct inter-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>pretation of inancial accounting. Choice &nbsp; is wrong, because &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>something so important would not be discretionary (optional). </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Choice &nbsp; may be true, but it is not as important for guidelines &nbsp; b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to be convenient as it is for them to be rigorous. Choice &nbsp; is &nbsp; c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>wrong because the word &nbsp; austere &nbsp; connotes sternness. People may </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>be stern, but inanimate entities, such as guidelines, cannot be.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>accounting. On the other hand, the second sentence of the &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>passage speaks of a &nbsp; marketing department &nbsp;, separate from the &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>accounting department &nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;258. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; The inal sentence is an instance of a regular pattern that still </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>has an uncanny quality. Choices &nbsp; and &nbsp; would introduce a &nbsp; &nbsp;b &nbsp;c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sentence with an idea contradicting the preceding. Choice &nbsp; &nbsp; d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>would indicate that the inal sentence is a restatement of the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>preceding, which it is not.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;259. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The passage says that people in general consider genius &nbsp; super-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>natural, but also . . . eccentric &nbsp;; the pairing of &nbsp; extraordinary &nbsp; and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>erratic &nbsp; in choice &nbsp; includes both meanings given in the passage. &nbsp; d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Choices &nbsp; and &nbsp; cover only one side of the passage’s meaning. &nbsp; a &nbsp;c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Choice &nbsp; contains deinitions that the passage does not ascribe &nbsp; b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to the common view of genius.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;260. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; This title covers the main point of the passage that, although </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>there are predictable patterns in the lives of geniuses, the &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>pattern increases the sense of something supernatural touching </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>their lives. Choices &nbsp; and &nbsp; are too general. Choice &nbsp; is inaccu- &nbsp;a &nbsp;b &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>rate because the passage does not talk about disorder in the life </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of a genius.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;261. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; All the other statements are inaccurate.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;262. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; This choice sticks to the subject, Daniel O’Connell. It provides </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a transition to the sentence following it by giving information </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>about the location of the statue. Choices &nbsp; and &nbsp; swerve off &nbsp; b &nbsp;c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>topic, and choice &nbsp; essentially repeats information given else- &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>where in the paragraph.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;263. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The title &nbsp; Sights and History on Dublin’s O’Connell Street &nbsp; touches </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>on all the speciic subjects of the passage: the sights to see on this </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>particular street and the history connected to them. Choice &nbsp; is &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>too general about the place described, which is a particular street </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in Dublin, not the whole city. Choices &nbsp; and &nbsp; are too speciic in &nbsp; b &nbsp;c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>that they cover only the material in the irst paragraph.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;264. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; The hidden or key resource mentioned in the passage is the ine </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>distinction between the deinition of &nbsp; street &nbsp; and &nbsp; boulevard &nbsp;, which is </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>used to win the argument with or &nbsp; get the better of &nbsp; tourists. Choices </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;265. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The author offers an example of Dublin wit and mentions &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the &nbsp; unhurried &nbsp; pace of Dublin crowds. Choice &nbsp; interprets the &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>adjective &nbsp; unhurried &nbsp; in too negative a manner for the tone of the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>passage. Choices &nbsp; and &nbsp; similarly interpret the playful joke on &nbsp; b &nbsp;c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>French tourists too disparagingly.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;266. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; This is implied in the irst passage, which says that Dilly’s is </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>“popular,” and the same idea is explicitly stated in the second &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>passage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;267. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp; This is the only one of the choices that is implied in both passages.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;268. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;This is the only quotation from the second passage that reveals </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the critic’s opinion of the quality of the food.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;269. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; The fact that the overall tone of the passage is quite negative </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>indicates the writer’s purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;270. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; In contrast to the second passage, the irst passage seems to be </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>encouraging a visit to Dilly’s. Choices &nbsp;, &nbsp;, and &nbsp;are not men- &nbsp;a b &nbsp; &nbsp; d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tioned in the passage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;271. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The issue which is causing conlict is the question of whether or </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>not to build a skate board park. Several residents were quoted </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>who had very different opinions, but none of the other choices </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>was addressed.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;272. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;Betty Kelly is quoted, addressing her concerns that kids in town </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>have no place to go, so they stay home and play video games. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>She might or might not agree with the other choices, but we are </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>not told her opinions in this passage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;273. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The word &nbsp; vehemence &nbsp; means passion or strong feeling. The pas-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sage tells us that the public spoke out passionately on the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;274. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; This is stated in the irst paragraph.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;275. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;This answer is broad enough to support all the information </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>discussed in the passage: chemicals in the home, research on </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>certain houseplants, the suggestion of the best plants for the job </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and why. Choice &nbsp; only deals with contaminants. Choice &nbsp; sug- &nbsp;a &nbsp;b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>gests our allergies are caused by chemicals in the home, when </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the passage suggests that we unknowingly blame our symptoms </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>on allergies. Choice &nbsp; suggests that the passage is only about &nbsp; c</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;276. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; This is explicitly stated in the passage. Choice &nbsp; is an incor- &nbsp;a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>rect assumption, as the passage does not discuss allergies; it </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>states that we dismiss the symptoms, blaming allergies as the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>cause. Choice &nbsp; is tempting, but it is not a speciic effect of the &nbsp; b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>chemicals combining; it merely states that ridding our homes of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>impurities seems a great task. Choice &nbsp; is incorrect because the &nbsp; d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>combination of harmful chemicals does not trigger the process </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of photosynthesis in any way.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;277. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; It is clearly stated that research has been done using &nbsp; certain &nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>houseplants. Choice &nbsp; is incorrect because the sentence that &nbsp; b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>deals with NASA suggests that &nbsp; even &nbsp; NASA is conducting experi-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ments. Choice &nbsp; reveals a faulty reading of the passage in which &nbsp; c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>three of the chemicals are clearly named. Choice &nbsp; is incorrect &nbsp; d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>because the main idea of the passage is for the beneit of &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>homeowners.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;278. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;This answer is inferred in the last line of the passage: &nbsp; primal </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>qualities . . . ability to purify their environment. &nbsp; Choices &nbsp; and &nbsp; &nbsp; a &nbsp;c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>are incorrect because &nbsp; antiquity &nbsp; refers to how long the species </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>has been on the planet, which has no relationship to how long a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>life span the individual plants or leaves have. Choice &nbsp; is incor- &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>rect. One cannot make a general statement on how successful </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the plants’ reactions are in research experiments when the pas-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sage only presents us with one type of research experiment.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;279. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; This title focuses on the main idea of the passage: purifying </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>one’s home of chemical impurities by using common house-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>plants. Choice &nbsp; is incorrect because only one experiment is &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>discussed, and no mention of the millennium is made at all. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Choice &nbsp; is also incorrect because the passage only discusses &nbsp; b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>one problem: impurities caused by chemicals, which is not even </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>labeled as a danger. Choice &nbsp; is supported by two sentences in &nbsp; d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the passage, but it is not broad enough to support all the infor-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>mation offered in the passage.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>every detail. Read every set of directions as many times as necessary. Also, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>read the title and footnotes carefully.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The ability to completely understand directions, graphs, charts, and </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>notice 2</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Beginning next month, the city will institute a program intended to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>remove grafiti from city-owned delivery trucks. Any truck that in-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ishes its assigned route before the end of the driver’s shift will return </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to its lot where supervisors will provide materials for that driver to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>use while cleaning the truck. Because the length of time it takes to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>complete different tasks and routes vary, trucks within the same </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>department will no longer be assigned to speciic routes but will be </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>rotated among the routes. Therefore, drivers should no longer leave </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>personal items in the trucks, because they will not necessarily be driv-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ing the same truck each day, as they did in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 311. &nbsp; &nbsp;According to the passage, the removal of grafiti from trucks will </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>be done by</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; a small group of drivers speciically assigned to the task.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; custodians who work for the city.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; any supervisor or driver who inishes a route irst.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; each driver as that driver inishes the assigned route.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 312. &nbsp; &nbsp;According to the passage, routes within particular departments</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; vary in the amount of time they take to complete.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; vary in the amount of grafiti they are likely to have on them.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; are all approximately of equal length.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; vary according to the truck’s driver.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 313. &nbsp; &nbsp;According to the passage, prior to instituting the grafiti clean-up </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>program, city workers</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; were not responsible for cleaning the trucks.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; had to repaint the trucks at intervals.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; usually drove the same truck each workday.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>then right onto Wingtip Dr. Windsor Blvd. is your third left, and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>we’re about halfway down on the right. Please wear a tie.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 314. &nbsp; &nbsp;What street will you be on when you reach Windsor Blvd.?</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>all Drivers Take note</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The City Transit supervisors have received numerous complaints </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>over the last several weeks about buses on several routes running </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>hot. Drivers are reminded that each route has several checkpoints at </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>which drivers should check the time. If the bus is ahead of schedule, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>drivers should delay at the checkpoint until it is the proper time to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>leave. If trafic makes it unsafe for a driver to delay at a particular </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>checkpoint, the driver should proceed at a reasonable speed to the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>next stop and hold there until the bus is back on schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 315. &nbsp; &nbsp;According to the passage, when a bus is &nbsp; running hot &nbsp;, it means</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; the bus is going too fast and the engine is overheating.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; the bus is running ahead of schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; the bus is running behind schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; passengers are complaining about the bus being off schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 316. &nbsp; &nbsp;The main point of the passage is that drivers should</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; stop their buses when trafic is unsafe.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; drive at a reasonable speed.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; check the time at every stop.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>reaction times and hand-eye coordination.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>As an added beneit, the city expects to save money with the </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Analyzing and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Interpreting Poems</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Poetry &nbsp;scares &nbsp;some &nbsp;people, &nbsp; mainly &nbsp;because &nbsp;they &nbsp;believe &nbsp;that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>poems have hidden meanings. A good way to approach poetry is by reading </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>closely for the literal meaning. In reality, poetry compresses the language </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>into small sentences or phrases, so it just seems that the meanings are hid-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>den. Ask yourself, what is that poet’s view on the subject? If you add a few </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of your own thoughts and experiences, you can uncover what has been </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>left out. Think of it as frozen orange juice. Add water and you have the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>entire amount. Also, remember that poets compare objects to other objects </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>. . . just like the frozen orange-juice metaphor. Think back to Chapter 2, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Analogies, and remember the way you made comparisons there.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>As you begin to read the poems in this section, it is important to under-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>stand who is speaking in the poem. (The speaker may not be the poet.) </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Once you can identify the narrator, you should be able to get an idea of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the narrator’s attitude toward the subject, and this is easily discovered by </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the author’s word choice. Through the images that the words make, you </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>It’s true that poems often have two levels—one literal, one igurative. </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; reverence</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 337. &nbsp; &nbsp;The poem implies that the attitude of the lowers toward the frost </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>The wretch, concentred all in self,</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>This next poem is by William Shakespeare.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The Seven ages of man</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>All the world’s a stage,</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>And all the men and women merely players;</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>They have their exits and their entrances;</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>And one man in his time plays many parts.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>His acts being seven ages. At irst the infant,</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Mewling . . . in the nurse’s arms.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>And then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>And shining morning face . . . And then the lover,</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Sighing like a furnace . . . Then a soldier</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Full of strange oaths . . . Jealous of honor,</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Sudden and quick in quarrel . . . And then the &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;justice . . . </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Full of wise saws and modern instances;</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Into the lean and slippered pantaloon.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>With spectacles on nose and pouch on side.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp;. . . and his big manly voice, Turning again toward</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Childish treble, pipes and whistles in his sound.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Last scene of all,</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>That ends this strange eventful history,</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Is second childishness, and mere oblivion,</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 346. &nbsp; &nbsp;What is the main idea of this poem?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; Life is a misery that never gets any better at any time.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; Life is what each of us makes of it during our journey down the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>river of eternity.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; Life is a play and it follows a speciic script, none of which </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>should cause anguish or sorrow.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; Life is a comedy, and we are all buffoons in pantaloons no mat-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ter what we do.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 347. &nbsp; &nbsp;What is the theme of the poem?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; Death is to be feared.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; Life is a circle that brings us back to the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; The male of the species is the only true measure of the stages of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>life.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; The stages of life are unrelated and can be altered by each indi-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>vidual’s free will.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 348. &nbsp; &nbsp;The poet uses the words &nbsp; merely &nbsp; (line 2) and &nbsp; mere &nbsp; (line 20)</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; to soften the effect of the strong images he presents to us in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>those lines.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; to tie together his theme of the cycle of life.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; convey his tone to the reader.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; all of the above.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Answers</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;329. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The eagle, who &nbsp; watches from his mountain walls &nbsp; and falls &nbsp; like a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>thunderbolt &nbsp;, is depicted as too alert and dynamic to be dying </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(choice &nbsp;). There is really no joy depicted in the poem nor any &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sense that this is a baby eagle (choice &nbsp;), and there is no men- &nbsp;c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tion of baby birds the eagle might be watching over (choice &nbsp;). &nbsp; d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Saying that the eagle &nbsp; watches &nbsp; and then falls &nbsp; like a thunderbolt &nbsp; im-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>plies alertness and then striking, respectively. The most logical </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>choice is that the eagle is hunting.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;330. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The word &nbsp; azure &nbsp; means &nbsp; blue &nbsp; and is often used to describe the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sky. Neither a forest nor cliffs are azure (choices &nbsp; and &nbsp;), and &nbsp; a &nbsp;c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>nature is not mentioned as an entity in the poem (choice &nbsp;). &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;331. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; It is the &nbsp; wrinkled sea &nbsp; that &nbsp; crawls &nbsp; in the irst line of the second </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>stanza of the poem.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;332. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The &nbsp; fellow &nbsp; frightens the speaker— &nbsp;a, c, &nbsp; and &nbsp; are not frightening. &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;333. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; Tighter breathing &nbsp; indicates fear, as does &nbsp; zero at the bone &nbsp; (one is </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sometimes said to be cold with fear). Also, the subject is a snake, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>which is generally a feared animal.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;334. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; In context, the speaker is discussing animals, because he follows </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>with his contrasting attitude toward &nbsp; this fellow &nbsp;, meaning the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>snake. The other choices are all human beings.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;335. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;Stanza 3 contains the phrase &nbsp; when a boy &nbsp; implying the speaker </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>was a boy in the past and is now, therefore, an adult man.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;336. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The poem describes nature in terms of the murder of a happy </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>lower, and includes the words &nbsp; beheads &nbsp; and &nbsp; assassin &nbsp;; therefore, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the most logical description of the poet’s attitude would not be </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>delight, indifference, &nbsp; or &nbsp; reverence, &nbsp; but rather &nbsp; dismay &nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;337. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; The lower in the poem is &nbsp; happy &nbsp; and feels &nbsp; no surprise &nbsp; that it must </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>die, which implies &nbsp; acceptance &nbsp;. If there is any hint of &nbsp; fear &nbsp; or &nbsp; hor-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ror &nbsp; in the poem (choices &nbsp; and &nbsp;), it is on the part of the poet. &nbsp; a &nbsp;b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Nothing in the poem is described as feeling &nbsp; reverence &nbsp; (choice &nbsp;). &nbsp;d</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;338. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; A God who would approve of a happy lower being beheaded, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>while, apparently, the rest of the natural world (as exempliied </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>by the sun) remains unmoved, is probably not to be regarded as </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>benevolent or just (choices &nbsp; and &nbsp;). Approval does not connote &nbsp; a &nbsp;b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>anger (choice &nbsp;). The most logical choice is that, in this poem, &nbsp; d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>God is cruel (choice &nbsp;). &nbsp;c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;339. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The word &nbsp; pelf &nbsp; is an old fashioned term meaning wealth. The </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>context of the poem does not support any of the other choices.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;340. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; The poem’s title lets the reader know right away that the poem </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>is about patriotism. The poet focuses particularly on the person </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>who is &nbsp; not &nbsp; patriotic, however, suggesting that the one who hates </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>his own country will die without honor.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;341. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The phrase “doubly dying” causes the reader to stop and think </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>about what the poet is trying to suggest. Scott is saying that the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>unpatriotic person will die physically, just as the patriot will die </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>physically—but the unpatriotic person will also experience a sort </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of “second death” when he is completely forgotten in the future. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The patriot, by contrast, is remembered by future generations.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;342. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; The context of the poem is speaking of a person who cares </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>only about himself, caring nothing for his country. Therefore, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>concentred &nbsp; most nearly means “focused on or concerned with” </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>himself.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;343. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; Sir Walter Scott draws a bleak picture of the person who hates </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>his country. It is safe to assume, therefore, that he loved his </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>homeland.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;344. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The poet uses &nbsp; merely &nbsp; to simply make a statement with no emo-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tion attached to it. Therefore, the other answers are all incor-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>rect as anger, amusement, and sorrow are emotions.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;345. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; The soldier’s behavior is &nbsp; aggressive &nbsp;: cursing, jealous of others </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>who receive honor, quick to ight. The lines do not reveal a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sense of honor, but rather the soldier’s dishonorable behavior. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>There is no mention of dedication, nor anything to suggest a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>fear of cowardice.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;346. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; The poem begins by stating the “world is a stage” and that we </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>are “merely players.” There is no emotion attached to the exits </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and entrances of man in the poet’s tone, thus there is no need </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>for anguish or sorrow. Choice &nbsp; is eliminated by the descrip- &nbsp;a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tions of the lover and the justice; there is no misery attached to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>them. Choice &nbsp; discusses a metaphor of life as a journey down a &nbsp; b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>river, and choice &nbsp; states that life is a comedy. Neither of these &nbsp; d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>choices can be supported by the passage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;347. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;This is supported by the &nbsp; Last scene of all &nbsp; in which Shakespeare </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>suggests that old age is a second childhood that will lead to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>oblivion without control of the senses, like the infant in the irst </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>act. Man has come full circle back to his beginning. No fear of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>death is mentioned, nor is free will, so choices &nbsp; and &nbsp; are in- &nbsp;a &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>correct. Choice &nbsp; is incorrect because man is used as the subject &nbsp; c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of the entries, but never presented as a gender-speciic measure.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;348. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The poet accomplishes all three. It softens the effect of both </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>suggestions that we are only actors on the world’s stage, and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>that the seventh age of man results in oblivion. It ties his theme </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>together by carrying us from the irst stage to the last and then </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>back again, and the words convey his tone of indifference, as &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>discussed above.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>The answers to this section begin on page 169.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The ictional world of Nobel Prize winner Toni Morrison’s novel </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Sula &nbsp;—the African-American section of Medallion, Ohio, a commu-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>nity called the Bottom—is a place where people and natural things </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>are apt to go awry, to break from their prescribed boundaries, a place </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>where bizarre and unnatural happenings and strange reversals of the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ordinary are commonplace. The very naming of the setting of &nbsp; Sula &nbsp; is </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a turning upside-down of the expected; the Bottom is located high in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the hills. The novel is illed with images of mutilation, both psycho-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>logical and physical. A great part of the lives of the characters, there-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>fore, is taken up with making sense of the world, setting boundaries, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and devising methods to control what is essentially uncontrollable. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>One of the major devices used by the people of the Bottom is the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>seemingly universal one of creating a _______________; in this case, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the title character Sula—upon which to project both the evil they </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>ing night, critics and playgoers greeted the play with baflement </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and derision. The line, “Nothing happens, nobody comes, nobody </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>goes. It’s awful,” was met by a loud rejoinder of “Hear! Hear!” from </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>an audience member. ____________________________________. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>However, Harold Hobson’s review in &nbsp; The Sunday Times &nbsp; managed to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>recognize the play for what history has proven it to be, a revolution-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ary moment in theater.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 351. &nbsp; &nbsp;Which sentence, if inserted in the blank space on the previous </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>page, would make the best sense in the context of the passage?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; The director, Peter Hall, had to beg the theater management not </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to close the play immediately but to wait for the Sunday reviews.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; Despite the audience reaction, the cast and director believed in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the play.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; It looked as if &nbsp; Waiting for Godot &nbsp; was beginning a long run as the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>most controversial play of London’s 1955 season.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; Waiting for Godot &nbsp; was in danger of closing the irst week of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>its run and of becoming nothing more than a footnote in the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>annals of the English stage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 352. &nbsp; &nbsp;Judging from the information provided in the paragraph, which of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the following statements is accurate?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; The 1955 production of &nbsp; Waiting for Godot &nbsp; was the play’s irst </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>performance.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; Waiting for Godot &nbsp; was written by Peter Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; The sets and characters in &nbsp; Waiting for Godot &nbsp; were typical of </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Plato, the famous Greek philosopher, taught that the things of the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>world around us are merely copies or “shadows” of greater, eternal </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>realities. He used a metaphor of people living inside a cave to convey </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>his ideas. The people inside the cave could not see the world outside </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the cave, they could only see shadows of people and animals as they </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>passed by.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Plato was suggesting that the shadows would seem very real </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and alive to the people inside the cave, because that was all they had </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ever seen of the outside world. But these shadows were not the real, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>living creatures of the outside world, they were merely relections of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>them. Plato’s point was that this temporal world is a ______________ </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of some greater, eternal reality.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; explain.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 357. &nbsp; &nbsp;What is the main idea of Plato’s cave analogy?</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; Real things cast shadows.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>This is an excerpt from Mark Twain’s &nbsp; Roughing It &nbsp;. Twain gives an eye-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>witness account of the operation of the Pony Express, the West’s irst mail </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>system.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The little lat mail-pockets strapped under the rider’s thighs would </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>each hold about the bulk of a child’s primer. They held many an </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>important business chapter and newspaper letter, but these were </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>written on paper as airy and thin as gold-leaf, nearly, and thus bulk </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and weight were economized. The stagecoach traveled about a hun-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>dred to a hundred and twenty-ive miles a day (twenty-four hours), </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the pony-rider about two hundred and ifty. There were about eighty </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>pony-riders in the saddle all the time, night and day, stretching in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a long, scattering procession from Missouri to California, 40 lying </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>eastward, and 40 toward the west, and among them making 400 gal-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>lant horses earn a stirring livelihood and see a deal of scenery every </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>single day in the year.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>We had a consuming desire, from the beginning, to see a pony-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>rider, but somehow or other all that passed us and all that met us </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>managed to streak by in the night, and so we heard only a whiz and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a hail, and the swift phantom of the desert was gone before we could </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>get our heads out of the windows. But now we were expecting one </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>along every moment, and would see him in broad daylight. Presently </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the driver exclaims:</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>“HERE HE COMES!”</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Every neck is stretched further, and every eye strained wider. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Away across the endless dead level of the prairie a black speck appears </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>against the sky, and it is plain that it moves. Well, I should think so! </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>In a second or two it becomes a horse and rider, rising and falling, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>rising and falling, rising and falling—sweeping toward us nearer and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>nearer—growing more and more distinct, more and more sharply </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>deined—nearer and still nearer, and the lutter of the hoofs comes </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>faintly to the ear—another instant a whoop and a hurrah from our </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>upper deck, a wave of the rider’s hand, but no reply, and a man and a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>horse burst past our excited faces, and go swinging away like a belated </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>fragment of a storm!</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Answers</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;349. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; A &nbsp; scapegoat &nbsp; is one who is forced to bear the blame for others or </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>upon which the sins of a community are heaped. Choices &nbsp; and &nbsp; b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c &nbsp; are wrong because nowhere in the passage is it implied that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Sula is a hero or leader, or even that the Bottom has such a per-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sonage. Sula may be a &nbsp; victim &nbsp; (choice &nbsp;), but a community does &nbsp; d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>not necessarily project evil onto a victim or an outcast the way </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>they do onto a scapegoat, so choice &nbsp; is still the best answer. &nbsp;a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;350. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The passage says that people who live in the Bottom are &nbsp; apt to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>go awry, to break from their prescribed boundaries &nbsp;. A person who is </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>eccentric is quirky or odd. Nowhere in the passage is it implied </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>that the people are furtive, suspicious, or unkempt (choices &nbsp;, , &nbsp; a &nbsp;b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and &nbsp;). &nbsp;c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;351. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;It is logical that a play would close after such a bad irst-night </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>reception, and the sentence in choice &nbsp; also uses a metaphor &nbsp; d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>about stage history, which is extended in the next sentence. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Choices &nbsp;, , and &nbsp; do not it the sense or syntax of the paragraph, &nbsp; a &nbsp;b &nbsp;c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>because the &nbsp; however &nbsp; in the next sentence contradicts them.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;352. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The irst line of the passage describes the &nbsp; English language pre-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>miere &nbsp; of the play, indi-cating it had previous performances in a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>different language.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;353. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; Although the other choices are sometimes connotations of the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>term &nbsp; avant-garde &nbsp;, the author’s meaning of &nbsp; innovative &nbsp; is supported </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>by the inal judgment of the passage on the play as revolutionary.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;354. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;Although the writer seems amused by the negative criticisms of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the play, she does give the opinion that it was revolutionary (a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>word that literally means “a turning point”). Choice &nbsp; under- &nbsp;a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>plays and choice &nbsp; overestimates the importance of the work to &nbsp; b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the author of the passage. Choice &nbsp; is contradicted by the last &nbsp; c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sentence of the passage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;355. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; Plato’s philosophy taught that the world is a picture or “shad-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ow” of eternity. The other choices would mean the opposite of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>what the passage is saying.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;356. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The word &nbsp; convey &nbsp; literally means to move or carry. Plato’s meta-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>phor was intended to “carry” an idea to the reader, so “explain” </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>is the best choice.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;357. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; Plato’s point was that there is another eternal reality apart from </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the world as we know it. Real objects do cast shadows, but that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>is not the main point of the passage, so choice &nbsp; is not the best &nbsp; d</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;358. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The author of the passage is merely explaining Plato’s phi-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>losophy. He is not trying to convince the reader that Plato was </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>either right or wrong, and he is not attempting to amuse or </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;359. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; The passage is describing Plato’s cave analogy, so choice &nbsp; is the &nbsp; c</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;360. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The word &nbsp; temporal &nbsp; means temporary, something that does not </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>The walnut tree produces wood that is used for countless purposes, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and is considered the inest wood in the world. The wood is easy to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>work with, yet it is very hard and durable—and when it is polished, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>it produces a rich, dark luster. It also shrinks and swells less than any </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>other wood, which makes it especially desirable for ine furniture, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>looring, and even gun stocks.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>In fact, just about every part of the walnut is unusually hard and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>strong. The nut of the tree is encased inside a very hard shell, which itself </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>is enclosed in a leathery outer covering called a husk. It requires real </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>effort to break through those layers to get at the tasty meat inside.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Yet every part of the walnut is useful to people. The outer husk </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>produces a dark reddish stain that is hard to remove from the hands </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of the person who opens the nut, and this pigment is widely used in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>dyes and wood stains. The inner shell is used as an abrasive to clean </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>jet engines. And the meat of the nut is extensively used in cooking, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ice cream, lavorings—and just eaten raw.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Walnut trees exude a chemical into the soil near their roots </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>which can be poisonous to some trees and shrubs. Fruit trees, for </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>example, will not survive if planted too close to a walnut. Many other </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>plants, such as maple trees or ivy, are not affected by the walnut’s </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>presence, and are well-suited to grow in its vicinity.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 365. &nbsp; &nbsp;What is the topic of this passage?</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Today, bicycles are elegantly simple machines that are common </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>around the world. Many people ride bicycles for recreation, whereas </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>others use them as a means of transportation. The irst bicycle, called </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a &nbsp; draisienne &nbsp;, was invented in Germany in 1818 by Baron Karl de Drais </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>de Sauerbrun. Because it was made of wood, the &nbsp; draisienne &nbsp; wasn’t </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>very durable nor did it have pedals. Riders moved it by pushing their </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>feet against the ground.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>In 1839, Kirkpatrick Macmillan, a Scottish blacksmith, invented </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a much better bicycle. Macmillan’s machine had tires with iron rims </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to keep them from getting worn down. He also used foot-operated </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>cranks, similar to pedals, so his bicycle could be ridden at a quick </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>pace. It didn’t look much like the modern bicycle, though, because </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>its back wheel was substantially larger than its front wheel. Although </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Macmillan’s bicycles could be ridden easily, they were never pro-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>duced in large numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>In 1861, Frenchman Pierre Michaux and his brother Ernest </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>invented a bicycle with an improved crank mechanism. They called </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>their bicycle a &nbsp; vélocipède &nbsp;, but most people called it a “bone shaker” </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>because of the jarring effect of the wood and iron frame. Despite </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the unlattering nickname, the &nbsp; vélocipède &nbsp; was a hit. After a few years, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the Michaux family was making hundreds of the machines annually, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>mostly for fun-seeking young people.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Ten years later, James Starley, an English inventor, made sev-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>eral innovations that revolutionized bicycle design. He made the </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>front wheel many times larger than the back wheel, put a gear on the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>pedals to make the bicycle more eficient, and lightened the wheels </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>by using wire spokes. Although this bicycle was much lighter and less </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tiring to ride, it was still clumsy, extremely top-heavy, and ridden </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>mostly for entertainment.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>It wasn’t until 1874 that the irst truly modern bicycle appeared </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>on the scene. Invented by another Englishman, H. J. Lawson, the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>safety bicycle would look familiar to today’s cyclists. The safety </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>bicycle had equal-sized wheels, which made it much less prone to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>toppling over. Lawson also attached a chain to the pedals to drive the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>rear wheel. By 1893, the safety bicycle had been further improved </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>with air-illed rubber tires, a diamond-shaped frame, and easy brak-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ing. With the improvements provided by Lawson, bicycles became </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>extremely popular and useful for transportation. Today, they are </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>built, used, and enjoyed all over the world.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 370. &nbsp; &nbsp;There is enough information in this passage to show that</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>One of the most hazardous conditions a ireighter will ever encoun-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ter is a backdraft (also known as a smoke explosion). A backdraft can </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>occur in the hot-smoldering phase of a ire when burning is incom-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>plete and there is not enough oxygen to sustain the ire. Unburned </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>carbon particles and other lammable products, combined with the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>intense heat, may cause instantaneous combustion if more oxygen </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>reaches the ire.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Fireighters should be aware of the conditions that indicate the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>possibility for a backdraft to occur. When there is a lack of oxygen dur-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ing a ire, the smoke becomes illed with carbon dioxide or carbon mon-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>oxide and turns dense gray or black. Other warning signs of a potential </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>backdraft are little or no visible lame, excessive heat, smoke leaving the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>building in puffs, mufled sounds, and smoke-stained windows.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Proper ventilation will make a backdraft less likely. Opening a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>room or building at the highest point allows heated gases and smoke </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to be released gradually. However, suddenly breaking a window or </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>opening a door is a mistake, because it allows oxygen to rush in, caus-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ing an explosion.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 378. &nbsp; &nbsp;To prevent the possibility of a backdraft, a ireighter should</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; is more likely to cause a backdraft.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The human body can tolerate only a small range of temperature, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>especially when the person is engaged in vigorous activity. Heat </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>reactions usually occur when large amounts of water and/or salt are </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>lost through excessive sweating following strenuous exercise. When </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the body becomes overheated and cannot eliminate this excess heat, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>heat exhaustion and heat stroke are possible.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Heat exhaustion is generally characterized by clammy skin, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>fatigue, nausea, dizziness, profuse perspiration, and sometimes faint-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ing, resulting from an inadequate intake of water and the loss of lu-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ids. First aid treatment for this condition includes having the victim </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>lie down, raising the feet 8 to 12 inches, applying cool, wet cloths to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the skin, and giving the victim sips of salt water (1 teaspoon per glass, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>half a glass every 15 minutes) over a 1-hour period.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Heat stroke is much more serious; it is an immediate life-threat-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ening situation. The characteristics of heat stroke are a high body </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>temperature (which may reach 106° F or more); a rapid pulse; hot, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>dry skin; and a blocked sweating mechanism. Victims of this condi-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tion may be unconscious, and irst-aid measures should be directed </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>at quickly cooling the body. The victim should be placed in a tub </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of cold water or repeatedly sponged with cool water until his or her </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>temperature is suficiently lowered. Fans or air conditioners will also </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>help with the cooling process. Care should be taken, however, not to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>over-chill the victim once the temperature is below 102° F.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>remodeling. The inlammation also causes an increase in airway </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>responsiveness. During an asthma attack, the patient attempts to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>compensate by breathing at a higher lung volume in order to keep </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the air lowing through the constricted airways, and the greater the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>airway limitation, the higher the lung volume must be to keep air-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ways open. The morphologic changes that occur in asthma include </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>bronchial iniltration by inlammatory cells. Key effector cells in the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>inlammatory response are the mast cells, T lymphocytes, and eosino-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>phils. Mast cells and eosinophils are also signiicant participants in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>allergic responses, hence the similarities between allergic reactions </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and asthma attacks. Other changes include mucus plugging of the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>airways, interstitial edema, and microvascular leakage. Destruction of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>bronchial epithelium and thickening of the subbasement membrane </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>is also characteristic. In addition, there may be hypertrophy and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>hyperplasia of airway smooth muscle, increase in goblet cell number, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and enlargement of submucous glands.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Although causes of the initial tendency toward inlammation </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in the airways of patients with asthma are not yet certain, to date </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the strongest identiied risk factor is atopy. This inherited familial </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tendency to have allergic reactions includes increased sensitivity to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>allergens that are risk factors for developing asthma. Some of these </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>allergens include domestic dust mites, animals with fur, cockroaches, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>pollens, and molds. Additionally, asthma may be triggered by viral </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>respiratory infections, especially in children. By avoiding these aller-</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>gens and triggers, a person with asthma lowers his or her risk of irri-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tating sensitive airways. A few avoidance techniques include: keeping </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the home clean and well ventilated, using an air conditioner in the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>summer months when pollen and mold counts are high, and getting </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>an annual inluenza vaccination. Of course, asthma sufferers should </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>avoid tobacco smoke altogether. Cigar, cigarette, or pipe smoke is a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>trigger whether the patient smokes or inhales &nbsp; the smoke from others. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Smoke increases the risk of allergic sensitization in children, increases </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the severity of symptoms, and may be fatal in children who already </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>have asthma. Many of the risk factors for developing asthma may also </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>provoke asthma attacks, and people with asthma may have one or </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>more triggers, which vary from individual to individual. The risk can </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>be further reduced by taking medications that decrease airway inlam-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>mation. Most exacerbations can be prevented by the combination of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>avoiding triggers and taking anti-inlammatory medications. An excep-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tion is physical activity, which is a common trigger of exacerbations </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in asthma patients. However, asthma patients should not necessarily </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>avoid all physical exertion, because some types of activity have been </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>proven to reduce symptoms. Rather, they should work in conjunction </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>with a doctor to design a proper training regimen, which includes the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>use of medication.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>In order to diagnose asthma, a healthcare professional must </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>appreciate the underlying disorder that leads to asthma symptoms </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and understand how to recognize the condition through information </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>gathered from the patient’s history, physical examination, measure-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ments of lung function, and allergic status. Because asthma symp-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>toms vary throughout the day, the respiratory system may appear </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>normal during physical examination. Clinical signs are more likely </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to be present when a patient is experiencing symptoms; however, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the absence of symptoms upon examination does not exclude the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>diagnosis of asthma.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 390. &nbsp; &nbsp;Why might a patient with asthma have an apparently normal respi-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ratory system during an examination by a doctor?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; Asthma symptoms come and go throughout the day.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; Severe asthma occurs only after strenuous physical exertion.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 392. &nbsp; &nbsp;What is the reason given in this article for why passive smoke </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>should be avoided by children?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; A smoke-illed room is a breeding ground for viral respiratory </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>infections.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; Smoke can stunt an asthmatic child’s growth.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; Smoke can heighten the intensity of asthma symptoms.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; Breathing smoke can lead to a fatal asthma attack.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Millions of people in the United States are affected by eating dis-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>orders. More than 90% of those aflicted are adolescents or young </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>adult women. Although all eating disorders share some common </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>manifestations, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>each have distinctive symptoms and risks.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>People who intentionally starve themselves (even while expe-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>riencing severe hunger pains) suffer from anorexia nervosa. The </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>disorder, which usually begins around the time of puberty, involves </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>extreme weight loss to at least 15% below the individual’s normal </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>body weight. Many people with the disorder look emaciated but are </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>convinced they are overweight. In patients with anorexia nervosa, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>starvation can damage vital organs such as the heart and brain. To </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>protect itself, the body shifts into slow gear: Menstrual periods stop, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>blood pressure rates drop, and thyroid function slows. Excessive </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>thirst and frequent urination may occur. Dehydration contributes to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>constipation, and reduced body fat leads to lowered body tempera-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ture and the inability to withstand cold. Mild anemia, swollen joints, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>reduced muscle mass, and light-headedness also commonly occur in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>anorexia nervosa.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Anorexia nervosa sufferers can exhibit sudden angry outbursts </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>or become socially withdrawn. One in ten cases of anorexia nervosa </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>leads to death from starvation, cardiac arrest, other medical com-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>plications, or suicide. Clinical depression and anxiety place many </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>individuals with eating disorders at risk for suicidal behavior.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>People with bulimia nervosa consume large amounts of food </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and then rid their bodies of the excess calories by vomiting, abusing </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>laxatives or diuretics, taking enemas, or exercising obsessively. Some </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>use a combination of all these forms of purging. Individuals with </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>bulimia who use drugs to stimulate vomiting, bowel movements, or </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>urination may be in considerable danger, as this practice increases </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the risk of heart failure. Dieting heavily between episodes of binging </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and purging is common.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Because many individuals with bulimia binge and purge in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>secret and maintain normal or above normal body weight, they can </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>often successfully hide their problem for years. But bulimia nervosa </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>patients—even those of normal weight—can severely damage their </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>bodies by frequent binge eating and purging. In rare instances, binge </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>eating causes the stomach to rupture; purging may result in heart </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>failure due to loss of vital minerals such as potassium. Vomiting can </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>cause the esophagus to become inlamed and glands near the cheeks to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>become swollen. As in anorexia nervosa, bulimia may lead to irregular </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>menstrual periods. Psychological effects include compulsive stealing </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>as well as possible indications of obsessive-compulsive disorder, an </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>illness characterized by repetitive thoughts and behaviors. Obsessive-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>compulsive disorder can also accompany anorexia nervosa. As with </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>anorexia nervosa, bulimia typically begins during adolescence. Even-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tually, half of those with anorexia nervosa will develop bulimia. The </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>condition occurs most often in women but is also found in men.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Binge-eating disorder is found in about 2% of the general pop-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ulation. As many as one-third of this group are men. It also affects </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>older women, though with less frequency. Recent research shows </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>that binge-eating disorder occurs in about 30% of people participat-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ing in medically supervised weight-control programs. This disorder </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>differs from bulimia because its sufferers do not purge. Individuals </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>with binge-eating disorder feel that they lose control of themselves </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>when eating. They eat large quantities of food and do not stop until </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>they are uncomfortably full. Most sufferers are overweight or obese </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and have a history of weight luctuations. As a result, they are prone </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Greyhound racing is the sixth most popular spectator sport in the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>United States. Over the last decade, a growing number of racers have </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>been adopted to spend their retirement as household pets, once their </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>racing careers are over.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Many people hesitate to adopt a retired racing greyhound </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>because they think only very old dogs are available. Actually, even </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>champion racers only work until they are about three-and-a-half </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>years old. Because greyhounds usually live to be 12 to 15 years old, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>their retirement is much longer than their racing careers.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>People worry that a greyhound will be more nervous and active </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>than other breeds and will need a large space to run. These are false </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>impressions. Greyhounds have naturally sweet, mild dispositions, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and while they love to run, they are sprinters rather than distance </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>runners and are suficiently exercised with a few daily laps around a </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Greyhounds do not make good watchdogs, but they are very </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>good with children, get along well with other dogs (and usually cats </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>as well), and are affectionate and loyal. They are intelligent, well-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>behaved dogs, usually housebroken in only a few days. A retired </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>racing greyhound is a wonderful pet for almost anyone.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 402. &nbsp; &nbsp;Based on the tone of the passage, the author’s main purpose is to</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; teach prospective owners how to transform their racing grey-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>hound into a good pet.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; show how the greyhound’s nature makes it equally good as </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 404. &nbsp; &nbsp;Which of the following is implied by the passage?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; The public is more aware of greyhounds than they used to be.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; Greyhounds are more competitive than other dogs.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; Greyhound racing should not be allowed.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; People who own pet rabbits should not adopt greyhounds.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 405. &nbsp; &nbsp;One drawback of adopting a greyhound is that</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; greyhounds are not good with children.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; greyhounds are old when they retire from racing.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; the greyhound’s sensitivity makes it temperamental.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; greyhounds are not good watch dogs.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 406. &nbsp; &nbsp;This passage is most like an advertisement because it</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; uses statistics to prove its point.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; does not present information to substantiate its claims.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; says nothing negative about greyhounds.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; encourages people to do something.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 407. &nbsp; &nbsp;According to the passage, a retired racing greyhound available for </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>adoption will most likely be</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; happy to be retiring.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; easily housebroken.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; a champion, or else it would have been euthanized.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; less high-strung than those that are not available for adoption.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The lives of the Ancient Greeks revolved around &nbsp; eris &nbsp;, a concept by </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>which they deined the universe. They believed that the world existed </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in a condition of opposites. If there was good, then there was evil, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>if there was love, then there was hatred; joy, then sorrow; war then </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>peace; and so on. The Greeks believed that good &nbsp; eris &nbsp; occured when </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>one held a balanced outlook on life and coped with problems as they </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>arose. It was a kind of ease of living that came from trying to bring </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>together the great opposing forces in nature. Bad &nbsp; eris &nbsp; was evident in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the violent conditions that ruled men’s lives. Although these things </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>were found in nature and sometimes could not be controlled, it was </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>believed that bad &nbsp; eris &nbsp; occurred when one ignored a problem, letting </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>it grow larger until it destroyed not only that person, but his family </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>as well. The Ancient Greeks saw &nbsp; eris &nbsp; as a goddess: Eris, the Goddess </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of Discord, better known as Trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>One myth that expresses this concept of bad &nbsp; eris &nbsp; deals with the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>marriage of King Peleus and the river goddess Thetis. Zeus, the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>supreme ruler, learns that Thetis would bear a child strong enough to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>destroy its father. Not wanting to father his own ruin, Zeus convinces </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Thetis to marry a human, a mortal whose child could never challenge </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the gods. He promises her, among other things, the greatest wedding </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in all of Heaven and Earth and allows the couple to invite whom-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ever they please. This is one of the irst mixed marriages of Greek </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Mythology and the lesson learned from it still applies today. They </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>do invite everyone . . . except Eris, the Goddess of Discord. In other </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>words, instead of facing the problems brought on by a mixed mar-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>riage, they turn their backs on them. They refused to deal directly </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>with their problems and the result is tragic. In her fury, Eris arrives, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ruins the wedding, causes a jealous feud between the three major </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>goddesses over a golden apple, and sets in place the conditions that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>lead to the Trojan War. The war would take place 20 years in the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>future, but it would result in the death of the only child of the bride </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and groom, Achilles. Eris would destroy the parents’ hopes for their </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>future, leaving the couple with no legitimate heirs to the throne.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Hence, when we are told, “If you don’t invite trouble, trouble </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>comes,” it means that if we don’t deal with our problems, our prob-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>lems will deal with us . . . with a vengeance! It is easy to see why the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Greeks considered many of their myths learning myths, for this one </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>teaches us the best way to defeat that which can destroy us.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 408. &nbsp; &nbsp;According to the passage, the ancient Greeks believed that the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>concept of &nbsp; eris &nbsp; deined the universe</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; as a hostile, violent place.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; as a condition of opposites.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; as a series of problems.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; as a mixture of gods and man.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 409. &nbsp; &nbsp;Most speciically, &nbsp; bad &nbsp; eris is deined in the passage as</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; the violent conditions of life.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; the problems man encounters.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; the evil goddess who has a golden apple.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 410. &nbsp; &nbsp;It can be inferred that Zeus married Thetis off because</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; he needed to buy the loyalty of a great king of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; he feared the gods would create bad eris by competing over her.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; he feared the Trojan War would be fought over her.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; he feared having an affair with her and, subsequently, a child &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>by her.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 411. &nbsp; &nbsp;It can also be inferred that Zeus did not fear a child sired by King </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Peleus because</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; he knew that the child could not climb Mt. Olympus.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; he knew that the child would be killed in the Trojan War.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; he knew that no matter how strong a mortal child was, he </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>torches, and with two huge footmen in knee breeches made drowsy </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>delightedly exclaim: “Ah, a good homemade beef stew! There’s noth-</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>gorgeous china. She yearned for wall hangings peopled with knights </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>robe, no jewels, nothing. And those were the only things that she </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>of this woman?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; She married but was ashamed of the insigniicant position her </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>husband held.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; She married on the rebound after a wealthy suitor had aban-</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; She married for love without realizing the consequences to her </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>whereas his wife views these comforts as cause for her anguish.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; The husband has ceased to enjoy the simple things and only </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>strives to quench his wife’s insatiable desire for luxury.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>Arteries of the heart blocked by plaque can reduce the low of blood </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to the heart possibly resulting in heart attack or death. Plaque is </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>actually fat and cholesterol that accumulates on the inside of the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>arteries. The arteries of the heart are small and can be blocked by </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>such accumulations. There is a medical procedure that creates more </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>space in the blocked artery by inserting and inlating a tiny balloon </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>into the blood vessel. It is called coronary balloon angioplasty. &nbsp; Angio-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>plasty &nbsp; means “blood vessel repair.” When the balloon is inlated, it </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>compresses the plaque against the wall of the artery, creating more </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>space and improving the low of blood.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Many doctors choose this technique, because it is less invasive </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>than bypass surgery. Yes, both involve entering the body cavity, but </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in bypass surgery, the chest must be opened, the ribs must be cut, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and the section of diseased artery must be removed and replaced. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>To replace it, the patient’s body is opened, once again, to acquire a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>healthy section of artery. Usually, this blood vessel is removed from </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>an artery located in the calf of the leg. This means the patient now </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>has two painful incisions that must heal at the same time. There is far </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>more risk in such bypass surgery than in angioplasty, which involves </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>threading a thin tube, called a catheter, into the circulatory system </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and working it to the damaged artery.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Angioplasty may take between 30 minutes to 3 hours to com-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>plete. It begins with a distinctive dye that is injected into the blood-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>stream. A thin catheter is then inserted into the femoral artery of the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>leg, near the groin. The doctor monitors the path of the dye using </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>x-rays. He moves the tube through the heart and into the plaque-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>illed artery. He inlates the balloon, creating more space, delates </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the balloon, and removes the tube. It is important to note that the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>plaque has not been removed; it has just been compressed against the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sides of the artery. Sometimes, a &nbsp; stent &nbsp; may be implanted, a tiny tube </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of stainless steel that is expandable when necessary. Its function is to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>keep the artery open.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>of surgeons stands ready to perform bypass surgery if needed. The </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>length of hospitalization is only three days. The bad news is twofold. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>First, this procedure treats the condition but does not eradicate the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>cause. In 20% of the cases, there is a recurrence of plaque. Second, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>angioplasty is not recommended for all patients. The surgeons must </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>consider the patient’s age, physical history, how severe the blockage </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>is, and, inally, the degree of damage to the artery before they make </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>their determination.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 420. &nbsp; &nbsp;When coronary arteries are blocked by plaque, one of the results </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>could be</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; femoral artery deterioration.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 421. &nbsp; &nbsp;According to the passage, angioplasty is deined as</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>The next passages are typical of those you might ind in textbooks. The </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>paragraphs are numbered for convenience.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(1) For centuries, time was measured by the position of the sun with </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the use of sundials. Noon was recognized when the sun was the high-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>est in the sky, and cities would set their clock by this apparent solar </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>time, even though some cities would often be on a slightly different </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>time. Daylight Saving Time (DST), sometimes called summer time, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>was instituted to make better use of daylight. Thus, clocks are set </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>forward one hour in the spring to move an hour of daylight from </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the morning to the evening and then set back one hour in the fall to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>return to normal daylight.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(2) Benjamin Franklin irst conceived the idea of daylight saving </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>during his tenure as an American delegate in Paris in 1984 and wrote </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>about it extensively in his essay, “An Economical Project.” It is said </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>that Franklin awoke early one morning and was surprised to see the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sunlight at such an hour. Always the economist, Franklin believed </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the practice of moving the time could save on the use of candlelight, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>as candles were expensive at the time. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(3) In England, builder William Willett (1857–1915) became a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>strong supporter for Daylight Saving Time upon noticing blinds of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>many houses were closed on an early sunny morning. Willet believed </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>everyone, including himself, would appreciate longer hours of light </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in the evenings. In 1909, Sir Robert Pearce introduced a bill in the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>House of Commons to make it obligatory to adjust the clocks. A bill </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>was drafted and introduced into Parliament several times but met </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>with great opposition, mostly from farmers. Eventually, in 1925, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>it was decided that summer time should begin on the day follow-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ing the third Saturday in April and close after the irst Saturday in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>October.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(4) The U.S. Congress passed the Standard Time Act of 1918 </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to establish standard time and preserve and set Daylight Saving Time </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>across the continent. This act also devised ive time zones throughout </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the United States: Eastern, Central, Mountain, Paciic, and Alaska. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The irst time zone was set on “the mean astronomical time of the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>seventy-ifth degree of longitude west from Greenwich” (England). </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>In 1919, this act was repealed. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(5) President Roosevelt established year-round Daylight Sav-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ing Time (also called War Time) from 1942–1945. However, after </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>this period, each state adopted its own DST, which proved to be </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>disconcerting to television and radio broadcasting and transporta-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tion. In 1966, President Lyndon Johnson created the Department of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Transportation and signed the Uniform Time Act. As a result, the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Department of Transportation was given the responsibility for the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>time laws. During the oil embargo and energy crisis of the 1970s, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>President Richard Nixon extended DST through the Daylight Sav-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ing Time Energy Act of 1973 to conserve energy further. This law </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>was modiied in 1986, and Daylight Saving Time was reset to begin </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>on the irst Sunday in April (to spring ahead) and end on the last </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>(1) Milton Hershey was born near the small village of Derry Church, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Pennsylvania, in 1857. It was a __________ beginning that did not </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>foretell his later popularity. Milton only attended school through the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>fourth grade; at that point, he was apprenticed to a printer in a nearby </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>town. Fortunately for all chocolate lovers, Milton did not excel as a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>printer. After a while, he left the printing business and was appren-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ticed to a Lancaster, Pennsylvania candy maker. It was apparent he </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>had found his calling in life, and at the age of eighteen, he opened </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>his own candy store in Philadelphia. In spite of his talents as a candy </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>maker, the shop failed after six years.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(2) It may come as a surprise to current Milton Hershey fans, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>but his irst candy success came with the manufacture of caramel. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>After the failure of his Philadelphia store, Milton headed for Denver, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>where he learned the art of making caramels. There he took a job </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>with a local manufacturer who insisted on using fresh milk in mak-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ing his caramels; Milton saw that this made the caramels especially </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tasty. After a time in Denver, Milton once again attempted to open </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>his own candy-making businesses, in Chicago, New Orleans, and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>New York City. Finally, in 1886, he went to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>where he raised the money necessary to try again. This company—</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the Lancaster Caramel Company—established Milton’s reputation </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>as a master candy maker.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>(3) In 1893, Milton attended the Chicago International Expo-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sition, where he saw a display of German chocolate-making imple-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ments. Captivated by the equipment, he purchased it for his Lancaster </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>candy factory and began producing chocolate, which he used for </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>coating his caramels. By the next year, production had grown to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>include cocoa, sweet chocolate, and baking chocolate. The Hershey </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Chocolate company was born in 1894 as a subsidiary of the Lancaster </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Caramel Company. Six years later, Milton sold the caramel company, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>but retained the rights, and the equipment, to make chocolate. He </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>believed that a large market of chocolate consumers was waiting for </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>someone to produce reasonably priced candy. He was right.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(4) Milton Hershey returned to the village where he had been </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>born, in the heart of dairy country, and opened his chocolate manu-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>facturing plant. With access to all the fresh milk he needed, he began </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>producing the inest milk chocolate. The plant that opened in a small </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Pennsylvania village in 1905 is today the largest chocolate factory </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in the world. The confections created at this facility are favorites </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>around the world.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(5) The area where the factory is located is now known as Her-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>shey, Pennsylvania. Within the irst decades of its existence, the town </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of Hershey thrived, as did the chocolate business. A bank, a school, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>churches, a department store, even a park and a trolley system all </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>appeared in short order; the town soon even had a zoo. Today, a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>visit to the area reveals the Hershey Medical Center, Milton Hershey </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>School, and Hershey’s Chocolate World—a theme park where visitors </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>are greeted by a giant Reeses Peanut Butter Cup. All of these things—</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and a huge number of happy chocolate lovers—were made possible </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>because a caramel maker visited the Chicago Exposition of 1893!</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; Reeses Peanut Butter Cups are manufactured by the Hershey </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Chocolate Company.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; Chocolate had never been manufactured in the United States </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>before Milton Hershey did it.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; The Hershey Chocolate Company now makes more money </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>(1) By using tiny probes as neural prostheses, scientists may be able to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>restore nerve function in quadriplegics and make the blind see or the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>deaf hear. Thanks to advanced techniques, a single, small, implanted </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>probe can stimulate individual neurons electrically or chemically and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>then record responses. Preliminary results suggest that the micro-</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>damaged or missing nerves.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(2) The tissue-compatible microprobes represent an advance </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>over the typical aluminum wire electrodes used in studies of the cor-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tex and other brain structures. Researchers accumulate much data </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>using traditional electrodes, but there is a question of how much </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>damage they cause to the nervous system. Microprobes, which are </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>about as thin as a human hair, cause minimal damage and disruption </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of neurons when inserted into the brain.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(3) In addition to recording nervous-system impulses, the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>microprobes have minuscule channels that open the way for deliv-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ery of drugs, cellular growth factors, neurotransmitters, and other </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>neuroactive compounds to a single neuron or to groups of neurons. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Also, patients who lack certain biochemicals could receive doses via </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 440. &nbsp; &nbsp;All of the following are mentioned in the passage as potential uses </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>for prostheses except</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; transportation of medication.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; induction of physical movement.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; transportation of growth factor.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; study the brain.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(1) Medical waste has been a growing concern because of recent inci-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>dents of public exposure to discarded blood vials, needles (sharps), </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>empty prescription bottles, and syringes. Medical waste can typically </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>include general refuse, human blood and blood products, cultures </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and stocks of infectious agents, laboratory animal carcasses, contami-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>nated bedding material, and pathological wastes.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(2) Wastes are generally collected by gravity chutes, carts, or </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>pneumatic tubes, each of which has its own advantages and disad-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>vantages. Chutes are limited to vertical transport, and there is some </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>risk of exhausting contaminants into hallways if a door is left open </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>during use. Another disadvantage of gravity chutes is that the waste </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>container may get jammed while dropping, or it may be broken upon </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>hitting the bottom. Carts are primarily for horizontal transport of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>bagged or containerized wastes. The main risk here is that bags </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>may be broken or torn during transport, potentially exposing the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>worker to the wastes. Using automated carts can reduce the potential </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>for exposure. Pneumatic tubes offer the best performance for waste </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>transport in a large facility. Advantages include high-speed move-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ment, movement in any direction, and minimal intermediate storage </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of untreated wastes. However, some objects cannot be conveyed </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>pneumatically.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(3) Off-site disposal of regulated medical wastes remains a viable </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>option for smaller hospitals (those with less than 150 beds). Some pre-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>liminary on-site processing, such as compaction or hydropulping, may </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp;= Page 214 =</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>be necessary prior to sending the waste off site. Compaction reduces </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the total volume of solid wastes, often reducing transportation and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>disposal costs, but it does not change the hazardous characteristics of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the waste. Compaction may not be economical if transportation and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>disposal costs are based on weight rather than volume.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(4) Hydropulping involves grinding the waste in the presence of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>an oxidizing luid, such as hypochlorite solution. The liquid is sepa-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>rated from the pulp and discharged directly into the sewer unless local </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>limits require additional pretreatment prior to discharge. The pulp </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>can often be disposed of at a landill. One advantage is that waste can </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>be rendered innocuous and reduced in size within the same system. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Disadvantages are the added operating burden, dificulty of controlling </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>fugitive emissions, and the dificulty of conducting microbiological </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tests to determine whether all organic matters and infectious organ-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>isms have been destroyed from the waste.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(5) On-site disposal is a feasible alternative for hospitals gen-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>erating two tons or more per day of total solid waste. Common </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>treatment techniques include steam sterilization and incineration. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Although other options are available, incineration is currently the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>preferred method for on-site treatment of hospital waste.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(6) Steam sterilization is limited in the types of medical waste it </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>can treat, but is appropriate for laboratory cultures and/or substances </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>contaminated with infectious organisms. The waste is subjected to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>steam in a sealed, pressurized chamber. The liquid that may form </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>is drained off to the sewer or sent for processing. The unit is then </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>reopened after a vapor release to the atmosphere, and the solid waste </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>is removed for further processing or disposal. One advantage of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>steam sterilization is that it has been used for many years in hospitals </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to sterilize instruments and containers and to treat small quantities of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>waste. However, since sterilization does not change the appearance </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of the waste, there could be a problem in gaining acceptance of the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>waste for landilling.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(7) A properly designed, maintained, and operated incinerator </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>achieves a relatively high level of organism destruction. Incineration </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>reduces the weight and volume of the waste as much as 95% and is </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>especially appropriate for pathological wastes and sharps. The most </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>common incineration system for medical waste is the controlled-air </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>type. The principal advantage of this type of incinerator is low par-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ticulate emissions. Rotary-kiln and grate-type units have been used, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>203</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>but use of grate-type units has been discontinued because of high air </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>emissions. The rotary kiln also puts out high emissions, and the costs </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>have been prohibitive for smaller units.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 442. &nbsp; &nbsp;Which of the following organizational schemes is most prevalent </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in the passage?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; chronological order</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; comparison-contrast</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; hierarchical order</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 443. &nbsp; &nbsp;One disadvantage of the compaction method of waste disposal is </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>that it</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; cannot reduce transportation costs.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; reduces the volume of solid waste material.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; does not allow hospitals to conirm that organic matter has been </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>eliminated.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 449. &nbsp; &nbsp;The process that transforms waste from hazardous to harmless &nbsp; and </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>them—that is, in their immediate context.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(1) The worst and longest economic crisis in the modern industrial </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>world, the Great Depression in the United States had devastating </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>consequences for American society. At its lowest depth (1932–33), </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>more than 16 million people were unemployed, more than 5,000 </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>banks had closed, and over 85,000 businesses had failed. Millions of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Americans lost their jobs, their savings, and even their homes. The </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>homeless built shacks for temporary shelter—these emerging shan-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tytowns were nicknamed Hoovervilles; a bitter homage to President </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Herbert Hoover, who refused to give government assistance to the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>jobless. The effects of the Depression—severe unemployment rates </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and a sharp drop in the production and sales of goods—could also be </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>felt abroad, where many European nations still struggled to recover </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>from World War I.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(2) Although the stock market crash of 1929 marked the onset </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of the depression, it was not the &nbsp; cause &nbsp; of it: Deep, underlying issures </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>already existed in the economy of the Roaring Twenties. For exam-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ple, the tariff and war-debt policies after World War I contributed </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to the instability of the banking system. American banks made loans </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to European countries following World War I. However, the United </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>States kept high tariffs on goods imported from other nations. These </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>policies worked against one another. If other countries could not sell </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>goods in the United States, they could not make enough money to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>pay back their loans or to buy American goods.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(3) And while the United States seemed to be enjoying a pros-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>perous period in the 1920s, the wealth was not evenly distributed. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Businesses made gains in productivity, but only one segment of the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>population—the wealthy—reaped large proits. Workers received </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>only a small share of the wealth they helped produce. At the same </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>time, Americans spent more than they earned. Advertising encour-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>aged Americans to buy cars, radios, and household appliances instead </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of saving or purchasing only what they could afford. Easy credit </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>policies allowed consumers to borrow money and accumulate debt. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Investors also wildly speculated on the stock market, often borrow-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ing money on credit to buy shares of a company. Stocks increased </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>beyond their worth, but investors were willing to pay inlated prices </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>because they believed stocks would continue to rise. This bubble </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>burst in the fall of 1929, when investors lost conidence that stock </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>prices would keep rising. As investors sold off stocks, the market spi-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>raled downward. The stock market crash affected the economy in the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>same way that a stressful event can affect the human body, lowering </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>its resistance to infection.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(4) The ensuing depression led to the election of President </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932. Roosevelt introduced relief measures </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>that would revive the economy and bring needed relief to Ameri-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>cans suffering the effects of the depression. In his 100 days in ofice, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Roosevelt and Congress passed major legislation that saved banks </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>from closing and regained public conidence. These measures, called </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the New Deal, included the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which paid </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>farmers to slow their production in order to stabilize food prices; the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insured bank deposits </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>if banks failed; and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>regulated the stock market. Although the New Deal offered relief, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>it did not end the Depression. The economy sagged until the nation </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>entered World War II. However, the New Deal changed the rela-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tionship between government and American citizens, by expanding </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the role of the central government in regulating the economy and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>creating social assistance programs.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 453. &nbsp; &nbsp;The author’s main point about the Great Depression is that</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; &nbsp;government policies had nothing to do with it.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; the government immediately stepped in with assistance for the </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;459. &nbsp; &nbsp;The content in the last paragraph of the passage would most likely </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>support which of the following statements?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; &nbsp;The New Deal policies were not radical enough in challenging </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>capitalism.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; The economic policies of the New Deal brought about a com-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>plete business recovery.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; &nbsp;The Agricultural Adjustment Act paid farmers to produce sur-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>plus crops.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; The federal government became more involved in caring for </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>needy members &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of society.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(1) The atmosphere forms a gaseous, protective envelope around </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Earth. It protects the planet from the cold of space, from harmful </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ultraviolet light, and from all but the largest meteors. After travel-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ing over 93 million miles, solar energy strikes the atmosphere and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Earth’s surface, warming the planet and creating what is known as </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the biosphere, the region of Earth capable of sustaining life. Solar </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>radiation in combination with the planet’s rotation causes the atmo-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sphere to circulate. Atmospheric circulation is one important reason </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>that life on Earth can exist at higher latitudes because equatorial heat </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>is transported poleward, moderating the climate.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(2) The equatorial region is the warmest part of the earth because </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>it receives the most direct and, therefore, strongest solar radiation. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The plane in which the earth revolves around the sun is called the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>1</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ecliptic &nbsp;. Earth’s axis is inclined 23 degrees with respect to the ecliptic. &nbsp; 3</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>This inclined axis is responsible for our changing seasons because, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>as seen from the earth, the sun oscillates back and forth across the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>equator in an annual cycle. On or about June 21 each year, the sun </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>1</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>reaches the Tropic of Cancer, 23 degrees north latitude. This is the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>3</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>northernmost point where the sun can be directly overhead. On or </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>about December 21 of each year, the sun reaches the Tropic of Cap-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>1</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ricorn, 23 degrees south latitude. This is the southernmost point at &nbsp; 3</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>which the sun can be directly overhead. The polar regions are the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>coldest parts of the earth because they receive the least direct and, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>therefore, the weakest solar radiation. Here solar radiation strikes </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>at a very oblique angle and thus spreads the same amount of energy </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>over a greater area than in the equatorial regions. A static envelope </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of air surrounding the earth would produce an extremely hot, unin-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>habitable equatorial region, while the polar regions would remain </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>inhospitably cold.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(3) The transport of water vapor in the atmosphere is an impor-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tant mechanism by which heat energy is redistributed poleward. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>When water evaporates into the air and becomes water vapor, it </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>absorbs energy. At the equator, air saturated with water vapor rises </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>high into the atmosphere where winds aloft carry it poleward. As </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>this moist air approaches the polar regions, it cools and sinks back to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>earth. At some point, the water vapor condenses out of the air as rain </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>or snow, releasing energy in the process. The now-dry polar air lows </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>back toward the equator to repeat the convection cycle. In this way, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>heat energy absorbed at the equator is deposited at the poles and the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>temperature gradient between these regions is reduced.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(4) The circulation of the atmosphere and the weather it gener-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ates is but one example of the many complex, interdependent events </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of nature. The web of life depends on the proper functioning of these </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>natural mechanisms for its continued existence. Global warming, the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>hole in the atmosphere’s ozone layer, and increasing air and water </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>pollution pose serious, long-term threats to the biosphere. Given the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>high degree of nature’s interconnectedness, it is quite possible that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the most serious threats have yet to be recognized.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp;460. &nbsp; &nbsp;Which of the following best expresses the main idea of the passage?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; The circulation of atmosphere, threatened by global warming </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and pollution, protects the biosphere and makes life on Earth </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>possible.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; If the protective atmosphere around the earth is too damaged </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>by human activity, all life on Earth will cease.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; Life on Earth is the result of complex interdependent events </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of nature, and some of these events are a result of human </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>intervention.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; The circulation of atmosphere is the single most important </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>factor in keeping the biosphere alive, and it is constantly threat-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ened by harmful human activity.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>on Earth?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; The equatorial region is the warmest part of the earth because it </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>(1) There are two types of diabetes, &nbsp; insulin-dependent &nbsp; and &nbsp; non-insulin-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>dependent &nbsp;. Between 90–95% of the estimated 13–14 million people </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in the United States with diabetes have non-insulin-dependent, or </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Type II, diabetes. Because this form of diabetes usually begins in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>adults over the age of 40 and is most common after the age of 55, it </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>used to be called adult-onset diabetes. Its symptoms often develop </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>gradually and are hard to identify at irst; therefore, nearly half of all </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>people with diabetes do not know they have it. For instance, some-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>one who has developed Type II diabetes may feel tired or ill without </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>knowing why. This can be particularly dangerous because untreated </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp;= Page 224 =</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>diabetes can cause damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and nerves. While the causes, short-term effects, and treatments of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the two types of diabetes differ, both types can cause the same long-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>term health problems.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(2) Most importantly, both types affect the body’s ability to use </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>digested food for energy. Diabetes does not interfere with diges-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tion, but it does prevent the body from using an important product </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of digestion, &nbsp; glucose &nbsp; (commonly known as sugar), for energy. After a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>meal, the normal digestive system breaks some food down into glu-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>cose. The blood carries the glucose or sugar throughout the body, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>causing blood glucose levels to rise. In response to this rise, the hor-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>mone insulin is released into the bloodstream and signals the body </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tissues to metabolize or burn the glucose for fuel, which causes blood </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>glucose levels to return to normal. The glucose that the body does </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>not use right away is stored in the liver, muscle, or fat.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(3) In both types of diabetes, however, this normal process mal-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>functions. A gland called the &nbsp; pancreas &nbsp;, found just behind the stomach, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>makes &nbsp; insulin &nbsp;. In people with insulin-dependent diabetes, the pan-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>creas does not produce insulin at all. This condition usually begins </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in childhood and is known as Type I (formerly called juvenile-onset) </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>diabetes. These patients must have daily insulin injections to survive. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>People with non-insulin-dependent diabetes usually produce some </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>insulin in their pancreas, but their bodies’ tissues do not respond well </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to the insulin signal and, therefore, do not metabolize the glucose </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>properly, a condition known as insulin resistance.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(4) Insulin resistance is an important factor in non-insulin-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>dependent diabetes, and scientists are searching for the causes of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>insulin resistance. They have identiied two possibilities. The irst is </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>that there could be a defect in the insulin receptors on cells. Like an </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>appliance that needs to be plugged into an electrical outlet, insulin </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>has to bind to a receptor in order to function. Several things can go </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>wrong with receptors. For example, there may not be enough recep-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tors to which &nbsp;insulin may bind, or a defect in the receptors may </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>prevent insulin from binding. The second possible cause of insulin </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>resistance is that, although insulin may bind to the receptors, the cells </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>do not read the signal to metabolize the glucose. Scientists continue </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to study these cells to see why this might happen.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(5) There’s no cure for diabetes yet. However, there are ways to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>alleviate its symptoms. In 1986, a National Institute of Health panel </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of experts recommended that the best treatment for non-insulin-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>dependent diabetes is a diet that helps one maintain a normal weight </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and pays particular attention to a proper balance of the different food </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>groups. Many experts, including those in the American Diabetes </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Association, recommend that 50–60% of daily calories come from </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>carbohydrates, 12–20% from protein, and no more than 30% from </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>fat. Foods that are rich in carbohydrates, like breads, cereals, fruits, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and vegetables, break down into glucose during digestion, causing </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>blood glucose to rise. Additionally, studies have shown that cooked </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>foods raise blood glucose higher than raw, unpeeled foods. A doctor </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>or nutritionist should always be consulted for more of this kind of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>information and for help in planning a diet to offset the effects of </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 471. &nbsp; &nbsp;Which of the following statements best summarizes the main </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>theme of the passage?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; Type I and Type II diabetes are best treated by maintaining a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>high-protein diet.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; Type II diabetes is a distinct condition &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>that can be managed by maintaining a healthy diet.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; Type I diabetes is an insidious condition most harmful when </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the patient is not taking daily insulin injections.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; Adults who suspect they may have Type II diabetes should </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>immediately adopt a high-carbohydrate diet.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 472. &nbsp; &nbsp;Which of the following is mentioned in the passage as a possible </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>problem with insulin receptors in insulin-resistant individuals?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; Overeating causes the receptors to function improperly.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; There may be an overabundance of receptors present.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; A defect causes the receptors to bind with glucose.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; A defect hinders the receptors from binding with insulin.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 473. &nbsp; &nbsp;According to the passage, in normal individuals, which of the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>following processes occur immediately after the digestive system </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>converts some food into glucose?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; The glucose is metabolized by body tissues.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; Insulin is released into the bloodstream.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; Blood sugar levels rise.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; The pancreas manufactures increased amounts of insulin.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 474. &nbsp; &nbsp;Based on the information in the passage, which of the following </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>best describes people with Type I diabetes?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; They do not need to be treated with injections of insulin.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; They comprise the majority of people with diabetes.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; Their pancreases do not produce insulin.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; They are usually diagnosed as adults.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>(1) The immune system is equal in complexity to the combined </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>intricacies of the brain and nervous system. The success of the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>immune system in defending the body relies on a dynamic regula-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tory communications network consisting of millions and millions of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>cells. Organized into sets and subsets, these cells pass information </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>back and forth like clouds of bees swarming around a hive. The result </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>is a sensitive system of checks and balances that produces an immune </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>response that is prompt, appropriate, effective, and self-limiting.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(2) At the heart of the immune system is the ability to distin-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>guish between self and non-self. When immune defenders encoun-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ter cells or organisms carrying foreign or non-self molecules, the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>immune troops move quickly to eliminate the intruders. Virtually </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>every body cell carries distinctive molecules that identify it as self. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The body’s immune defenses do not normally attack tissues that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>carry a self-marker. Rather, immune cells and other body cells coexist </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>peaceably in a state known as &nbsp; self-tolerance. &nbsp; When a normally func-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tioning immune system attacks a non-self molecule, the system has </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the ability to remember the speciics of the foreign body. Upon sub-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sequent encounters with the same species of molecules, the immune </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>system reacts accordingly. With the possible exception of antibodies </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>passed during lactation, this so-called immune system memory is </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>not inherited. Despite the occurrence of a virus in your family, your </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>immune system must learn from experience with the many millions </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of distinctive non-self molecules in the sea of microbes in which we </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>live. Learning entails producing the appropriate molecules and cells </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to match up with and counteract each non-self invader.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(3) Any substance capable of triggering an immune response </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>is called an &nbsp; antigen &nbsp;. Antigens are not to be confused with &nbsp; allergens, &nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>which are most often harmless substances (such as ragweed pollen or </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>cat hair) that provoke the immune system to set off the inappropriate </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and harmful response known as &nbsp; allergy &nbsp;. An antigen can be a virus, a </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>bacterium, a fungus, a parasite, or even a portion or product of one </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of these organisms. Tissues or cells from another individual (except </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>an identical twin, whose cells carry identical self-markers) also act as </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>antigens; because the immune system recognizes transplanted tissues </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>as foreign, it rejects them. The body will even reject nourishing pro-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>teins unless they are irst broken down by the digestive system into </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>their primary, non-antigenic building blocks. An antigen announces </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>its foreignness by means of intricate and characteristic shapes called </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>epitopes, &nbsp; which protrude from its surface. Most antigens, even the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>simplest microbes, carry several different kinds of epitopes on their </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>surface; some may even carry several hundred. Some epitopes will be </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>more effective than others at stimulating an immune response. Only </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in abnormal situations does the immune system wrongly identify self </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>as non-self and execute a misdirected immune attack. The result can </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>be a so-called autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis or sys-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>temic lupus erythematosis. The painful side effects of these diseases </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>are caused by a person’s immune system actually attacking itself.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; An antigen is any substance that triggers an immune response.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; The basic function of the immune system is to distinguish </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>between self and non-self.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 483. &nbsp; &nbsp;What is the meaning of the underlined word &nbsp; intricacies &nbsp; as it is used </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in the irst sentence of the passage?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; elaborate interconnections</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; confusion of pathways</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; inherent perplexity</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; comprehensive coverage</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(1) An upsurge of new research suggests that animals have a much </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>higher level of brainpower than previously thought. If animals do </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>have intelligence, how do scientists measure it? Before deining ani-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>mals’ intelligence, scientists deined what is not intelligence. &nbsp; Instinct &nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>is not intelligence. It is a skill programmed into an animal’s brain by </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>its genetic heritage. Rote conditioning is also not intelligence. Tricks </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>can be learned by repetition, but no real thinking is involved. &nbsp; Cuing &nbsp;, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in which animals learn to do or not to do certain things by following </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>outside signals, does not demonstrate intelligence. Scientists believe </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>that insight, the ability to use tools, and communication using human </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>language are all effective measures of the mental ability of animals.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(2) When judging animal intelligence, scientists look for insight, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>which they deine as a lash of sudden understanding. When a young </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>gorilla could not reach fruit from a tree, she noticed crates scattered </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>about the lawn near the tree. She piled the crates into a pyramid, then </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>climbed on them to reach her reward. The gorilla’s insight allowed </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>her to solve a new problem without trial and error.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(3) The ability to use tools is also an important sign of intel-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ligence. Crows use sticks to pry peanuts out of cracks. The crow </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>exhibits intelligence by showing it has learned what a stick can do. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Likewise, otters use rocks to crack open crab shells in order to get </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>at the meat. In a series of complex moves, chimpanzees have been </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>known to use sticks and stalks in order to get at a favorite snack—</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>termites. To make and use a termite tool, a chimp irst selects just </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the right stalk or twig. He trims and shapes the stick, then inds the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>entrance to a termite mound. While inserting the stick carefully </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>into the entrance, the chimpanzee turns it skillfully to it the inner </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tunnels. The chimp attracts the insects by shaking the twig. Then it </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>pulls the tool out without scraping off any termites. Finally, he uses </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>his lips to skim the termites into his mouth.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>(4) Many animals have learned to communicate using human </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>language. Some primates have learned hundreds of words in sign </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>language. One chimp can recognize and correctly use more than 250 </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>abstract symbols on a keyboard. These symbols represent human </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>words. An amazing parrot can distinguish ive objects of two different </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>types. He can understand the difference between the number, color, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and kind of object. The ability to classify is a basic thinking skill. He </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>seems to use language to express his needs and emotions. When ill </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and taken to the animal hospital for his irst overnight stay, this par-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>rot turned to go. “Come here!” he cried to a scientist who works with </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>him. “I love you. I’m sorry. Wanna go back?”</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(5) The research on animal intelligence raises important ques-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tions. If animals are smarter than once thought, would that change </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the way humans interact with them? Would humans stop hunting </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>them for sport or survival? Would animals still be used for food, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>clothing, or medical experimentation? Finding the answer to these </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tough questions makes a dificult puzzle even for a large-brained, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>problem-solving species like our own.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 484. &nbsp; &nbsp;Crows use sticks to pry peanuts out of cracks. Which of the fol-</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>(1) Photosynthesis is the process that plants use to convert sunlight </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>into the food that they need to survive and grow. Most plants create </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>some form of sugar from the sunlight, and this sugar is used by the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>plant as its primary food source.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(2) Plants actually need only three things to create this sugar: </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water. The sunlight reacts with the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>plant’s chlorophyll, a green chemical which is used to convert water </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and carbon dioxide into sugar.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(3) As a general rule, photosynthesis occurs in a plant’s leaves. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The leaf contains chlorophyll, which reacts when sunlight strikes the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>leaf. It is also the chlorophyll which gives the leaf its typical green </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>color, since photosynthesis absorbs most light rays except green, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>which are relected outwards.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(4) The process of photosynthesis produces more than just sugar, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>however. One byproduct of the process is oxygen, which is “exhaled” </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>by the plant into the atmosphere. In fact, plant photosynthesis is one </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of the primary sources of oxygen generation on our planet, making </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>plant life essential to almost all living things on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 490. &nbsp; &nbsp;According to paragraph 4, which of the following is a byproduct of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>photosynthesis?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; green pigment</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; water</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; carbon dioxide</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; oxygen</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 491. &nbsp; &nbsp;The underlined word &nbsp; essential &nbsp;, as used in paragraph 4, most nearly </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>means</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; optional.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; fragrant.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 492. &nbsp; &nbsp;The passage explains that photosynthesis is </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; done in the plant stem.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; what makes plants edible.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; the way that plants feed themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; the source of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 493. &nbsp; &nbsp;According to the passage, why do plant leaves look green?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; Leaves are actually &nbsp; not &nbsp; green.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; Photosynthesis absorbs all colors except green.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; Sugar is green.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; Photosynthesis requires green light to produce sugar.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 494. &nbsp; &nbsp;After reading the passage, what can you conclude about &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>photosynthesis?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; Chlorophyll is part of the ozone layer.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; Photosynthesis is the process that feeds a plant.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; Plants need oxygen to survive.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; The roots of a plant provide water.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp;495. &nbsp; &nbsp;After reading the passage, what can you infer about photosynthesis?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; Human life would not survive without plants.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; Chlorophyll tastes sweet.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; Sunlight has both good and bad effects on plants.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; Too much water can interfere with photosynthesis.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>(1) Abraham Lincoln served as the 16th President of the United States, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>yet he never went to college. In fact, Lincoln had nearly no formal edu-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>cation whatsoever, attending schools for less than a year throughout </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>his childhood. Yet this should not be construed to mean that Lincoln </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>was ignorant or unlearned; on the contrary, he was one of the most </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>well-read leaders of the time. The fact is that Abraham Lincoln edu-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>cated himself by studying books of religion, philosophy, and literature, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and he continued his voracious reading throughout his life.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(2) A lack of public school education did not prevent Lincoln </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>from becoming a great leader. He led the United States through </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>four years of civil war, which threatened to divide the nation into </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>two separate countries. He was a powerful opponent of slavery, and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>it was largely through his leadership that slavery was abolished in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>this country.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(3) Lincoln’s determination to educate himself through diligent </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>reading also led to his reputation as a great orator—and even today </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>his speeches are quoted and studied worldwide. He serves as an </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>example of a great leader—and a great reader. His love of books and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>good literature enabled Abe Lincoln to rise to world renown.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 496. &nbsp; &nbsp;What is the main idea of this passage?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; Abe Lincoln was the 16th President of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; Abe Lincoln demonstrated the value of reading.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; Abe Lincoln was a Republican.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; Abe Lincoln freed the slaves.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 497. &nbsp; &nbsp;Lincoln accomplished all of the following EXCEPT</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; preventing the United States from being divided.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; ending slavery.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; becoming a great leader.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; establishing the Lincoln Memorial.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 498. &nbsp; &nbsp;A &nbsp; voracious &nbsp; reader is</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; likely to become President.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; a person who makes reading a regular habit.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; someone who never went to school.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; probably poor.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 499. &nbsp; &nbsp;The underlined word &nbsp; construed &nbsp;, as used in paragraph 1, most nearly </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>means</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; tormented.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; taken apart.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; interpreted.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 500. &nbsp; &nbsp;According to the passage, what lesson can be learned from the life </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of Abraham Lincoln?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; Education is not important.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; All books are worth reading.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; Good reading habits can help a person do great things.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; Politicians are always good role models.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; 501. &nbsp; &nbsp;How does Lincoln still affect students today?</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a. &nbsp; His face is on money.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>b. &nbsp; His speeches are still quoted and studied today.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c. &nbsp; People grow beards to look like him.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d. &nbsp; Students quit school in hopes of becoming president.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6> &nbsp;Answers</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;365. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The topic is the broad, general subject of a passage. The pas-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sage tells the reader about walnut trees, so that is its topic.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;366. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The main idea is more speciic than the topic—it’s the point or </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>idea which the author wants to prove to the reader. Choice &nbsp; is &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>too broad; the passage is about walnut trees, not trees in gen-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>eral. Choices &nbsp; and &nbsp; are true, but they are merely part of the &nbsp; b &nbsp;c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>passage’s main idea. Choice &nbsp; summarizes the entire passage. &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;367. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; Something that is &nbsp; abrasive &nbsp; is rough or coarse, and cause friction </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>when rubbed against other objects.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;368. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; The reader can infer that the author supports planting walnut </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>trees, since he speaks of their great value and also gives instruc-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tions on what to plant next to them. None of the other choices </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>can be supported from the passage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;369. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; To &nbsp; exude &nbsp; is to exhale or to give off, the way that perfume “gives </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>off” an odor. The walnut roots give off chemicals, exuding them </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>out to the soil.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;370. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; This is the best choice because each paragraph of the pas-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sage describes an inventor whose machine was a step toward </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the modern bicycle. There is no evidence to support choice &nbsp;. &nbsp; b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Choices &nbsp; and &nbsp; are incorrect because they both make state- &nbsp;c &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ments that, according to the passage, are untrue.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;371. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The fourth paragraph states that &nbsp; James Starley &nbsp; added a gear to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the pedals.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;372. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The passage gives the history of the bicycle. Choice &nbsp; is incor- &nbsp;a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>rect because few opinions are included in the passage. There is </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>no support for choices &nbsp; and &nbsp;. &nbsp;b &nbsp;c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;373. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;This information is clearly stated in the second paragraph. The </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>iron rims kept the tires from getting worn down, and, therefore, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the tires lasted longer. Choice &nbsp; is incorrect because although &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the iron rims probably did make the machine heavier, that was </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>not Macmillan’s goal. Choice &nbsp; is incorrect because no infor- &nbsp;c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>mation is given about whether iron-rimmed or wooden tires </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>moved more smoothly. There is no support for choice &nbsp;. &nbsp;d</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;374. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;Based on the paragraph, this is the only possible choice. Starley </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>revolutionized &nbsp; the bicycle; that is, he made many innovative </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>changes. Based on the context, the other choices make no sense.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;375. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; This is the only choice that states an opinion. The writer can-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>not be certain that the safety bicycle would look familiar to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>today’s cyclists; it is his or her &nbsp; opinion &nbsp; that this is so. The other </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>choices are presented as facts.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;376. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The irst two sentences of the passage indicate that a backdraft </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>is dangerous because it is an explosion. The other choices are </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>dangers, but they do not deine a backdraft.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;377. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The second paragraph indicates that there is little or no visible </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>lame with a potential backdraft. The other choices are listed at </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the end of the second paragraph as warning signs of a potential </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>backdraft.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;378. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; This is stated in the last paragraph. Choice &nbsp; is not mentioned &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in the passage. The other choices would be useless or harmful.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;379. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; The passage indicates that hot, smoldering ires have little or </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>no visible lame and insuficient oxygen. It can reasonably be </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>inferred, then, that more oxygen would produce more visible </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>lames.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;380. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;This is stated in the last paragraph (. . . &nbsp; irst aid measures should </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>be directed at quickly cooling the body &nbsp;). The other responses are </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>irst aid for heat exhaustion victims.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;381. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;This is stated in the irst sentence of the second paragraph. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Choices &nbsp; and &nbsp; are symptoms of heat stroke. Choice &nbsp; is not &nbsp; a &nbsp;c &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;382. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; Heat stroke victims have a &nbsp; blocked sweating mechanism &nbsp;, as stated </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>in the third paragraph.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;383. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;This information is given in the second paragraph: If the victim </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>still suffers from the symptoms listed in the irst sentence of the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>paragraph, the victim needs more water and salt to help with </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the &nbsp; inadequate intake of water and the loss of luids &nbsp; that caused </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>those symptoms.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;384. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;Many asthma sufferers have an inherited tendency to have aller-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>gies, referred to as &nbsp; atopy &nbsp; in the third paragraph.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>501 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading Comprehension Questions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;385. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The fourth sentence of the second paragraph explains that dur-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ing an attack the person aflicted with asthma will compensate </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>for constricted airways by breathing a greater volume of air.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;386. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; The irst sentence of the passage begins, &nbsp; No longer &nbsp;, indicating </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>that in the past asthma was considered an anomalous inlamma-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tion of the bronchi. Now asthma is considered a chronic condi-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tion of the lungs.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;387. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;An exacerbation is usually deined as an &nbsp; aggravation of symptoms &nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>or &nbsp; increase in the severity &nbsp; of a disease. However, in this passage, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>exacerbations &nbsp; is interchangeable with &nbsp; asthma attacks &nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;388. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; Although cramping may occur during asthma attacks, it is not </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>mentioned in the passage. See the bottom half of the second </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>paragraph for a full explanation of the morphological effects of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>an attack.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;389. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The third paragraph discusses triggers in detail. Although using </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a fan in the summer months sounds good, an air conditioner </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>is recommended when the pollen count is high. Family pets </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and cigarette smoke are all distinctly inlammatory to asthma </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sufferers. Only physical activity is touted as a possible symptom </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>reducer.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;390. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; Because asthma symptoms vary throughout the day, relying on </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the presence of an attack or even just on the presence of a respi-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ratory ailment to diagnose asthma is lawed logic.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;391. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;All the individuals listed would glean a certain amount of knowl-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>edge from the passage; however, a healthcare professional would </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ind the broad overview of the effects of asthma, combined with </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the trigger avoidance and diagnosis information, most relevant. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>A research scientist would likely have all this information already. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>A mother with an asthmatic child would probably not be inter-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ested in the diagnosis protocol. The antismoking activist prob-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ably would not ind enough fodder in this article.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;392. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;According to the last part of the third paragraph, second-hand </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>smoke can increase the risk of allergic sensitization in children.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;393. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;See the third paragraph: “One in ten” (10% of) cases of anorexia </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;394. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; See the second and third paragraphs for reference to heart </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>problems with anorexia, the fourth and ifth paragraphs for dis-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>cussion of heart problems with bulimia, and the last paragraph, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>where heart disease is mentioned, as a risk in obese people who </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>suffer from binge-eating disorder.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;395. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; Near the end of the last paragraph, the passage indicates that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>binge-eating disorder patients experience high blood pressure.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;396. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;It is the other way around: 50% of people with anorexia develop </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>bulimia, as stated near the end of the ifth paragraph.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;397. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The irst sentence of the ifth paragraph tells us that bulimia </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sufferers are often able to keep their problem a secret, partly </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>because they maintain a normal or above-normal weight.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;398. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; In the second paragraph, the thyroid gland function is men-</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>protect itself.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;399. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; According to the second paragraph, dehydration contributes to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>constipation.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;400. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;As stated in the opening sentence of the fourth paragraph, buli-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>mia patients may exercise obsessively.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;401. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;See the second sentence of the sixth paragraph. If as many as </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>one-third of the binge-eating disorder population are men, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>it stands to reason that up to two-thirds are younger women, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>given that we have learned that about 90% of all eating disorder </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sufferers are adolescent and young adult women.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;402. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; The tone of the passage is enthusiastic in its recommendation </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of the greyhound as pet and, thereby, encourages people to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>adopt one. It does not give advice on transforming a greyhound </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(choice &nbsp;). Except to say that they love to run, the passage does &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>not spend equal time on describing the greyhound as racer </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(choice &nbsp;). The author’s tone is not objective (choice &nbsp;), but &nbsp; b &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>rather enthusiastic.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;403. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;See the last paragraph. The passage does not mention &nbsp; or &nbsp;. &nbsp; b &nbsp;c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Choice &nbsp; is clearly wrong; the passage states the opposite. &nbsp;a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;404. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; See the irst paragraph. Choices &nbsp;, , and &nbsp; are not touched on &nbsp; b &nbsp;c &nbsp;d</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;406. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The enthusiastic tone of the passage seems meant to encourage </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>people to adopt retired greyhounds. Choice &nbsp; is wrong because &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>there is only one statistic in the passage (in the irst sentence), </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and it is not used to prove the point that greyhounds make good </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>pets. Choice &nbsp; is wrong because the author substantiates every &nbsp; b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>point with information. Choice &nbsp; is wrong because the passage &nbsp; c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>does make the negative point that greyhounds do not make </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>good watchdogs.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;407. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;See the end of the next to last sentence in the passage. Choices </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a &nbsp;c &nbsp;, , and &nbsp; are not to be found in the passage. &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;408. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;This is stated explicitly in the second sentence of the passage. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Choice &nbsp; is incorrect because only bad eris was deined as vio- &nbsp;a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>lent. Choice &nbsp; deals with problems that belong in the domain &nbsp; c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of mankind, not the universe. Choice &nbsp; has no support in the &nbsp; d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>passage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;409. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; Again, this is a deinition explicitly stated in the sixth sentence. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Choice &nbsp; is incorrect because a choice dealing with mankind &nbsp; b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>alone is too narrow for a deinition of eris, which deals with the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>entire universe. Choice &nbsp; is incorrect because it only deals with &nbsp; c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>one action of the personiied concept in goddess form. Choice &nbsp; &nbsp; d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>has no support.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;410. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;This is stated in the third sentence of paragraph 2. Zeus did not </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>want to sire [father] a child who could eventually overthrow </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>him. According to the passage, he felt it was safer to arrange for </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the child’s father to be a mortal. There is no support in the pas-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sage for any of the other choices.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;411. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; This answer follows the logic of the previous answer. A mortal </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>child could never challenge the gods &nbsp; implies that Zeus feared that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>if the child were immortal, it would overthrow him. The other </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>choices mention individual words that appear in the passage but </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>have no support.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;412. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The second to the last line in paragraph 2 tells us that Achilles </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>was the son of Thetis and Peleus, and that the war will result in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>his death. Choice &nbsp; is incorrect because there is no other men- &nbsp;a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tion of Zeus or events in the Trojan War other than Achilles’ </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>death. Choice &nbsp; is incorrect because Eris purposely created the &nbsp; c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>conditions that would lead to the war to kill the child of the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>bride and groom. Choice &nbsp; is incorrect because Achilles is the &nbsp; d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>son of Thetis and Peleus, the bride and groom of the myth.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;413. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; This lesson is discussed explicitly in paragraph 3. All other </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>choices are irrelevant.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;414. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; The husband had a civil servant’s job and received a steady salary; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the wife had a servant who cleaned for her. The couple lived in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a dwelling that had several rooms. This implies that they lived </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>comfortably. Choice &nbsp; is incorrect because they obviously were &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>not impoverished. Choice &nbsp; is incorrect because the wife had &nbsp; b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a maid. Choice &nbsp; is incorrect because this was the life the wife &nbsp; d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>wanted to have, but instead had &nbsp; shabby walls, worn furniture &nbsp; etc.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;415. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;This question relates to the previous one. This choice pres-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ents the fact that the wife had a maid. Choice &nbsp; does not deal &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>with the couple’s economic standing, but only the wife’s before </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>she was married. Choice &nbsp; is tempting, but the poverty of her &nbsp; b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>rooms is more in her eyes than a truthful economic indicator. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>How poverty stricken can she be if she has a maid? Choice &nbsp; &nbsp; c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>deals with a tablecloth that has been used three days in a row. It </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>has nothing to do with economic standing because it could have </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>been washed by the maid or the wife, and the situation would </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>have been remedied.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;416. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; It is obvious from the description of the wife’s thoughts in the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>irst paragraph that she wished she had married a rich man. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Instead, she &nbsp; slipped into marriage with a minor civil servant &nbsp;. The </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>woman is ashamed of her marriage and of her husband’s oc-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>cupation to the point of making it sound like an accident, as </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>one may slip on a wet loor. Choices &nbsp;, , and &nbsp; are incorrect &nbsp; b &nbsp;c &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>because the wife loving anything other than expensive things is </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>never mentioned in the passage.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;417. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The husband’s delight with the homemade stew only seems </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to send his wife into another bout of daydreams to escape her </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>middle-class prison. Choice &nbsp; is blatantly incorrect, because the &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>husband obviously enjoys homemade beef stew while the wife </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>dreams of wings of grouse. Choice &nbsp; is incorrect because the hus- &nbsp;c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>band is either unaware of his wife’s anguish or doesn’t let it affect </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>his delight in his dinner. Choice &nbsp; is irrelevant to the passage. &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;418. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;This is reinforced by the last two sentences of the passage. The </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>wife admits she only loves rich things, believes she was made for </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>them, and focuses all her desires on being &nbsp; admired and sought &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>after &nbsp;, thinking only of herself at all times. Choice &nbsp; is incor- &nbsp;a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>rect because the author paints a negative picture of the wife. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Although choice &nbsp; is tempting, the author does not develop the &nbsp; b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>husband enough for him to become the focus of the passage. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Choice &nbsp; is incorrect because it is not developed in the passage. &nbsp; c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The focus is on the wife, not on class distinctions in general.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;419. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; Adjectives are the words that describe nouns. These are the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>words that truly add dimension to the descriptions of the home </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and the daydreams of the wife. &nbsp; Innate instinctive grandest gor- &nbsp;, &nbsp; , &nbsp; , </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>geous gleaming &nbsp;, &nbsp; , and &nbsp; pink &nbsp; are some of the adjectives that enrich </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the nouns of the wife’s dreams. &nbsp; Shabby worn ugly &nbsp;, &nbsp; , &nbsp; , and &nbsp; homemade &nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>are adjectives that add to the undesirable view she has of her </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>present situation. None of the other choices add such richness to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the passage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;420. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;This answer is explicitly stated in the irst sentence of the selec-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tion. Choices &nbsp; and &nbsp; are not mentioned as a result of plaque- &nbsp;a &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>laden arteries. Choice &nbsp; is too general to be the best answer. &nbsp;c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;421. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; This answer is explicitly stated in the sixth sentence of paragraph </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>1. Choice &nbsp; only names one medical instrument used during &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the procedure. Choice &nbsp; offers the reason for the angioplasty, &nbsp; b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>because it is done to compress the plaque in an artery. Choice </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d &nbsp; offers a procedure that would be chosen as an alternative to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>angioplasty.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;422. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; The irst and second sentences of paragraph 2 state how both </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>procedures, angioplasty and bypass surgery, are invasive because </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>“both involve entering the body cavity.” None of the other </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>ing a special dye. Choices &nbsp; and &nbsp; follow later in the procedure, &nbsp; a &nbsp;b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>whereas choice &nbsp; deals with bypass surgery rather than the &nbsp; d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>angioplasty procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;424. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;This answer can be found in paragraph 4. A team of surgeons </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>stands ready to perform bypass surgery even though the risk </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>factor of death is only 2%. Choice &nbsp; is not supported in the &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>passage. Choices &nbsp; and &nbsp; are incorrect because the passage does &nbsp; c &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>not discuss patient reaction at all.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;425. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; This choice is supported in the last sentence of paragraph </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>3. Choice &nbsp; is incorrect: The risk factor is 2%. Choice &nbsp; is a &nbsp; b &nbsp;c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>complete misunderstanding of the text. Inlating a balloon into </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a blocked artery is coronary balloon angioplasty. Because two </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>answers are incorrect, &nbsp; is not a viable choice. &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>426. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;Choices &nbsp;and &nbsp;, meaning scattered and erratic respectively, &nbsp; b &nbsp; c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>are not supported in the passage. Choice &nbsp; may be considered &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a synonym, but it is not the best choice. The best choice is &nbsp;, &nbsp; d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>requisite &nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>427. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;Paragraph 2 of the passage clearly states that Benjamin Franklin </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>irst considered the concept of DST.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>428. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;Paragraph 3 states that the bill (which was introduced by Sir </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Robert Pearce in 1909) met with great opposition, mostly from </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>farmers.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>429. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; This choice is directly supported by paragraph 5.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>430. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; Choices &nbsp; and &nbsp; are incorrect because they each refer to speciic &nbsp; b &nbsp;c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>points raised in the passage, but not throughout the passage. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Choice &nbsp; is too broad to represent the best title. Only choice &nbsp; &nbsp; d &nbsp;a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>describes the point of the entire passage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>431. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; Paragraph 5 clearly states that during the oil embargo and </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;432. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;This is an inference question. The writer indicates that visi-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tors to Hershey’s Chocolate World are greeted by a giant </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Reeses Peanut Butter Cup, so it is logical to assume that these </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>are manufactured by Hershey. Although the writer mentions </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the popularity of chocolate internationally, you cannot assume </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>that it is popular in every country (choice &nbsp;), nor is there any &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>indication that Milton Hershey was the irst person to manufac-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ture chocolate in the United States (choice &nbsp;). Choice &nbsp; is not &nbsp; c &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>discussed in the passage at all.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;433. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;This question tests your ability to use context clues to deter-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>mine the intended meaning of a word. In paragraph 3, the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>passage says, &nbsp; The Hershey Chocolate company was born in 1894 as a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>subsidiary of the Lancaster Caramel Company &nbsp;. This indicates that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a subsidiary is one controlled by another company, choice &nbsp;. &nbsp; d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Although it may be true that Milton Hershey owned each com-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>pany in its entirety (choice &nbsp;), that is not clear from the mate- &nbsp;a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>rial. There is also no indication that the chocolate company was </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>created to support the caramel company (choice &nbsp;). Finally, the &nbsp; b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>passage contains no discussion of whether or not any of Her-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>shey’s companies were incorporated (choice &nbsp;). &nbsp;c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;434. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; Choice &nbsp; is the best choice because it is the most complete &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>statement of the material. Choices &nbsp; and &nbsp; focus on small details &nbsp; c &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of the passage; choice &nbsp; is not discussed in the passage. &nbsp;b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;435. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;Paragraph 3 states that Hershey sold the caramel company six </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>years after the founding of the chocolate company. The choco-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>late company was founded in 1894; the correct choice is &nbsp;. &nbsp;b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;436. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; The Chicago International Exposition was where Hershey </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>saw a demonstration of German chocolate-making techniques, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>which indicates, along with the word &nbsp; international &nbsp; in its title, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>that the exposition contained displays from a variety of coun-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tries, choice &nbsp;. None of the other choices can be inferred from &nbsp; c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the information in the passage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;437. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;There is nothing inherently dramatic, undigniied, or rewarding </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>discussed in paragraph 1. &nbsp; Modest &nbsp; is the word that best its being </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>born in a small village and having the unremarkable early life </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>described; it is also a word that provides a contrast to the men-</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>That it reduces the volume of waste (choice &nbsp;) is an advantage, &nbsp; b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>not a disadvantage. Compaction is not designed to eliminate &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>organic matter, so conirming that it has been eliminated </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(choice &nbsp;) is not an issue. &nbsp;c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;444. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; See the last sentence of paragraph 5, which states that &nbsp; incinera-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tion is . . . the preferred method for on-site treatment &nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;445. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;See the last sentence of paragraph 6, which points out that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>steam sterilization does not change the appearance of the waste, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>thus perhaps raising questions at a landill.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>446. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; Paragraph 4 states that liquid is separated from pulp in the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>hydropulping process. Paragraph 6 says that liquid may form </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>during the sterilization process.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;447. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; This response relies on an understanding of pathological </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>wastes, which are wastes generated by infectious materials. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Paragraph 7 points out that incineration is especially appropri-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ate for pathological wastes. Previously, paragraph 6 had said </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>that steam sterilization is appropriate for substances contami-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>nated with infectious organisms.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;448. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The second paragraph says that the main risk of pushing carts is </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>potential exposure from torn bags but that automated carts can </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>reduce that potential.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;449. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;See the next to last sentence of paragraph 4. Sterilization does </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>not change the appearance of waste. Although compacting does </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>change the volume of the waste, it is not appropriate for elimi-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>nating hazardous materials.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;450. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;See the second sentence of paragraph 2: &nbsp; . . . there is some risk of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>exhausting contaminants into hallways &nbsp;, meaning waste might be </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>discharged.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;451. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;See the last sentence of the passage, which states that &nbsp; the costs </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>have been prohibitive for smaller units &nbsp; when using rotary kilns.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;452. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; Although the contaminants may sometimes be extremely toxic </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(choice &nbsp;), the word &nbsp; a &nbsp;fugitive &nbsp; here is the key to the meaning. The </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>words &nbsp; fugitive emissions &nbsp; are used in the context of the disposal </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>process of hydropulping. To be a fugitive means to run away </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>or to escape, so the logical choice, given this context, is choice </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c &nbsp;. There is nothing anywhere in the passage about criminal </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>activity, so choice &nbsp; is not a likely answer. Choice &nbsp; is wrong &nbsp; b &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>because the microbiological testing of which the passage speaks </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>pertains to ensuring that all waste is disposed of.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>453. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; According to the paragraph 2, &nbsp; Deep, underlying issures &nbsp; that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>already existed in the economy &nbsp; led to the Great Depression.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>454. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; The passage is primarily an account that describes the causative </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>factors (for example, tariff and war-debt policies, dispropor-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tionate wealth, and the accumulation of debt) that led to the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Depression and its effects (for example, business failures, bank </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>closings, homelessness, federal relief programs).</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>455. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; Paragraph 1 states that shantytowns were called &nbsp; Hoovervilles &nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>because citizens blamed their plight on the Hoover administra-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tion’s refusal to offer assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>456. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;Although policies can refer to regulations or &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;laws &nbsp; (choice &nbsp;) or &nbsp; c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>guiding principles or &nbsp; theories &nbsp; (choice &nbsp;), in this context, &nbsp; a &nbsp;policies &nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>refers to the courses of action that are taken, from which a gov-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ernment or business intends to inluence decisions or actions. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Choice &nbsp; is the only answer that implies action. &nbsp;b</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>457. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The passage describes the decade as one in which spending </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>dominated over prudent measures like saving (paragraph 3). </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The wild stock market speculation, also described in that para-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>graph, is another example of extravagance.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>458. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The analogy depicts the stock market crash of 1929 as a weak-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ening agent to the economy (the way a stressful event may </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>weaken the body’s resistance to illness).</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>459. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;This paragraph clearly states that the New Deal expanded the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>role of the central government in regulating the economy and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>creating social assistance programs. Choices &nbsp; and &nbsp; are incor- &nbsp;b &nbsp;c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>rect and choice &nbsp; requires an opinion; the author does not offer &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>his or her viewpoint about the New Deal measures.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;460. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; Choice &nbsp; emphasizes only damage to the atmosphere; the pas- &nbsp;b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sage encompasses more than that. Choice &nbsp; does not mention &nbsp; c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the atmosphere, which is the main focus of the passage. Choice </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>d &nbsp; is too narrow—the inal paragraph of the passage emphasizes </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>that the circulation of the atmosphere is but one example of the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>complex events that keeps the earth alive.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;461. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; This question assesses the ability to see the organization of a </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>reading passage and to organize material for study purposes. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Choice &nbsp; is wrong because the passage does not explain exactly &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>what will happen as a result of damage to the atmosphere and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>other life-sustaining mechanisms. Choice &nbsp; is wrong because &nbsp; b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the passage does not explain the origin of the atmosphere. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>Choice &nbsp; is wrong because it is solar energy that travels 93 mil- &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>lion miles through space, not the atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;462. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The &nbsp; biosphere &nbsp;, as deined in paragraph 1, is a &nbsp; region &nbsp; (or part) </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of the earth; it is not the envelope around the earth, the living </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>things on Earth, or the circulation of the atmosphere (choices &nbsp;, &nbsp;a &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>c &nbsp;, and &nbsp;). &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;463. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;This question assesses the ability to recognize supported and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>unsupported claims. Choice &nbsp; deals with solar radiation, not &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>with circulation of the atmosphere. Choice &nbsp; is an assertion &nbsp; b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>without speciic supporting detail. Choice &nbsp; describes how the &nbsp; c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>atmosphere protects Earth but does not speak of the circula-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tion of the atmosphere. Only choice &nbsp; explains that conditions &nbsp; d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>would be inhospitable at the equator and poles without the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>circulation of the atmosphere; therefore, it is the best choice.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;464. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; This question assesses the ability to see cause and effect. Para-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>graph 2 deals with how variations in the strength with which </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>solar radiation strikes the earth affects temperature. None </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of the other choices is discussed in terms of all temperature </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>changes on Earth.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;465. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; There is no mention in the irst paragraph of any &nbsp; reviving &nbsp; or </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>cleansing &nbsp; effect the atmosphere may have (choices &nbsp; and &nbsp;). In &nbsp; b &nbsp;d</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>a sense, enabling the earth to sustain life is invigorating; how-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ever, choice &nbsp; is a better choice because the irst two sentences &nbsp; a</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>talk about how the atmosphere &nbsp; protects &nbsp; the earth from harmful </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>forces.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;466. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;Paragraph 1 mentions that the symptoms of Type II diabetes </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>may occur gradually and thus be attributed to other causes. Left </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>untreated, diabetes can cause damage to several major organs in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the body.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;467. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;According to the beginning of paragraph 2, only the long-term </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>health problems are the same for these two different disorders.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;468. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;Paragraph 2 mentions that when the body has more glucose </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>than needed, it stores the overlow in muscle tissue, fat, or the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>liver.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;469. &nbsp;c. &nbsp; According to the last paragraph, non-insulin-dependent diabetics </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>should stick to a diet &nbsp; consisting of 50–60% carbohydrates. The </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>paragraph also notes that raw foods do not cause as high a blood </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sugar level as cooked foods.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;470. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; Paragraph 4 mentions that, although insulin must bind to a re-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ceptor in order to begin working, the main role of insulin is to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>signal the burning of glucose/sugar for energy. Most hormones </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>function as stimuli for other processes.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;471. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;Type II, or non-insulin-dependent, diabetes is the main subject </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>of the passage, which distinguishes Type II from Type I and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>goes on to stress the importance of diet.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;472. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;Paragraph 4 of the passage tells us that possible problems with </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>insulin receptors include a paucity of receptors or a defect caus-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ing improper binding of the insulin to the receptors. In addition, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>even though insulin may bind to its receptors, cells may fail to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>read the signal to metabolize the glucose.</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;473. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; Paragraph 2 states that normally, after the digestive system </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>breaks down food into smaller molecules, including glucose </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(otherwise known as sugar), the blood-sugar level rises. Insulin </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>is then released from the pancreas, thus signaling tissues to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>metabolize the glucose.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;474. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; Type I diabetes is the insulin-dependent form of this condition. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>The minority of diabetics are aflicted with this form. They are </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>diagnosed as children and must take daily injections of insulin </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>to compensate for what their pancreases do not produce.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;475. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; The inal paragraph says that there is no cure for diabetes, so </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>choices &nbsp; and &nbsp; are incorrect. Choice &nbsp; is a possibility, but con- &nbsp;b &nbsp;d &nbsp;c</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>sider the sound of the word &nbsp; soothe &nbsp;. It does not it with the objec-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>tive tone of the passage nearly as well as the word &nbsp; counteract &nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;476. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; In the irst paragraph, the communication network of the mil-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>lions of cells in the immune system is compared to bees swarm-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ing around a hive.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;477. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;All the answers indicate peaceful coexistence. However, accord-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ing to the ifth sentence of paragraph 2, in this instance, the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>state is referred to as &nbsp; self-tolerance.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;478. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; See the last paragraph. The substances known as &nbsp; allergens &nbsp; are </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>responsible for triggering an inappropriate immune response to </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ragweed pollen.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;479. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;The last paragraph of the passage mentions that an antigen an-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>nounces its foreignness with intricate shapes called &nbsp; epitopes &nbsp; that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>protrude from the surface.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;480. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; Every individual’s immune system must learn to recognize and </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>deal with non-self molecules through experience. However, the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>last section of paragraph 2 mentions that the immune system is </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>capable of choices &nbsp;, , and &nbsp; b &nbsp;c &nbsp;d.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;481. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;According to paragraph 2, the ability to distinguish between self </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>and non-self is the heart of the immune system. This topic is set </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>up in the irst paragraph and further elucidated throughout the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>body of the passage.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;482. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;The last paragraph mentions that tissues or cells from another </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;483. &nbsp; a. &nbsp; &nbsp; The context leads to the meaning: The irst sentence speaks of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>complexity, from which we can infer an elaborate system of in-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>terconnections, especially in light of the second sentence. There </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>is no mention of confusion in the passage (choice &nbsp;). The word &nbsp; b</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>perplexity &nbsp; means bewilderment and is unrelated to the passage </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>(choice &nbsp;). Choice &nbsp; is a newspaper and TV term that is &nbsp; &nbsp;c &nbsp;d</span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>as an analogy to illustrate the large and increasing amount of </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>research in animal intelligence.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;486. &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; The questions in this paragraph ask the reader to consider the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>use of animals in our world and questions whether knowing </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>that they have more intelligence than previously thought might </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>make a difference in human treatment of them.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;487. &nbsp; d. &nbsp; &nbsp;This choice is the only one that shows animals using human </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>language.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;488 &nbsp; c. &nbsp; &nbsp; Although each conclusion is an example of some intelligence, </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>the most accurate conclusion the reader should make is that </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>this action shows high intelligence. The complexity of what the </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>chimpanzee is doing to get his food and the many thinking activi-</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>ties he must accomplish in order to realize his goal of getting </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts6>remembering stored knowledge, using the correct knowledge in </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>order to take proper action for the situation—shows intelligence.</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts6>&nbsp; &nbsp;489. &nbsp; b. &nbsp; &nbsp;Cuing does not demonstrate animal intelligence because the </span></p>
