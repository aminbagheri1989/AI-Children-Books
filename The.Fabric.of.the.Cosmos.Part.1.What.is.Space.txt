THE FABRIC OF THE COSMOS:
WHAT IS SPACE?
PBS Airdate: November 2, 2011

Lying just beneath everyday reality
is a breathtaking world,

where much of what we perceive
about the universe is wrong.

Physicist and best-selling
author Brian Greene

takes you on a journey that bends
the rules of human experience.

Why don't we ever see events
unfold in reverse order?

According to the laws
of physics, this can happen.

It's a world that comes to light

as we probe the most extreme
realms of the cosmos,

from black holes

to the Big Bang

to the very heart of matter itself.

I'm gonna have what he's having.

Here, our universe may be one
of numerous parallel realities.

The three-dimensional world
maybe just an illusion

and there's no distinction
between past, present and future.

But how could this be?

How could we be so wrong
about something so familiar?

Does it bother us? Absolutely.

There's no principle built
into the laws of nature

that says that theoretical
physicists have to be happy.

It's a game-changing perspective

that opens up a whole
new world of possibilities.

Coming, up...

What if you took all this stuff away?

We're left with empty space

but what seems like nothing is actually
teeming with ferocious activity.

What is space?

It is one of the deepest
mysteries in physics.

Could these elusive ingredients hold
the key to the fate of the universe?

The Fabric of the Cosmos,

right now on NOVA.

We think of our world
as filled with stuff,

like buildings and cars,

buses and people.

And nowhere does that seem more apparent
than in a crowded city like New York.

Yet all around the stuff that
makes up our everyday world

is something just as important

but far more mysterious:

the space in which all
this stuff exists.

To get a feel for what
I'm talking about,

let's stop for a moment and imagine.

What if you took all this stuff away?

I mean all of it: the people,

the cars and buildings.

And not just the stuff here on Earth,

but the Earth itself;

what if you took away all the
planets, stars and galaxies?

And not just the big stuff,

but tiny things down to the very
last atoms of gas and dust;

what if you took it all
away? What would be left?

Most of us would say "nothing".
And we'd be right.

But strangely, we'd also be wrong.

What's left is empty space. And as it
turns out, empty space is not nothing.

It's something,

something with hidden characteristics

as real as all the stuff
in our everyday lives.

In fact, space is so real it can bend;

space can twist,

and it can ripple;

so real that empty space itself helps
shape everything in the world around us

and forms the very fabric of the cosmos.

You can't understand anything about the
world unless you understand space,

because that's the world: the
world's space with stuff in it.

We're not usually very
conscious of space.

But then again, I tell people, fish are
probably not conscious of water either,

and they're in it all the time.

Space is not really nothing; it
actually has a lot going on inside.

When most of us picture space,

we think of outer space, a
place that's far, far away.

But space is actually everywhere.

You could say it's the most
abundant thing in the universe.

Even the tiniest of things, like atoms,

the basic ingredient in you and me and

everything else we see in
the world around us,

even they are almost
entirely empty space.

In fact, if you removed all the
space inside all the atoms

making up the stone, glass and steel
of the Empire State Building,

you'd be left with a little lump,

about the size of a grain of rice

but weighing hundreds of
millions of pounds.

The rest is only empty space.

But what exactly is space?

I can show you a picture of Spain,

of Napoleon,

of my uncle Harold,

but space, it, looks like this:

nothing.

So how do you make sense of
something that looks like nothing?

Why is there space rather than no space?

Why is space three-dimensional?

Why is space big? We have a lot
of room to move around in.

How come it's not tiny?

We have no consensus about these things.

What is space? We actually
still don't really know.

It is one of the deepest
mysteries in physics.

Fortunately, we're not
completely in the dark.

We've been gathering clues
about space for centuries,

some of the earliest came
from thinking about

how objects move through space.

To get a feel for this, take
a look at that skater.

As she glides across the rink,

she's moving in relation
everything around her,

like the ice.

And when she goes into a spin,

not only can she see
that she's spinning,

she can also feel it,
because as she spins,

she feels her arms pulled outward.

But now, let's imagine that you could
take away all the stuff around her,

from the rink

to the most distant galaxies,

so the only thing left is the skater
spinning in completely empty space.

If the skater still feels
her arms pulled outward,

she'll know she's spinning.

But if empty space is nothing,

what is she spinning in relation to?

Imagine you're that skater.

When you look out, you
don't see anything.

It's just uniform, still
blackness all around you,

and yet, your arms are
being pulled outwards.

So you say to yourself, "What could
I be spinning with respect to?

Is there something out there
that I'm not seeing?"

Trying to answer questions like these,

scientists came up with a
bold new picture of space.

And the key was to make
something out of nothing.

Benedick: Lady Beatrice, thou
hast wept this whole while.

Beatrice: Yea. And I will
weep a while longer.

When you go to the theater,
you watch the actors,

Benedick: I do confess that I love
nothing in the world so well as thee.

the scenery, the story.

Benedick: I protest I love thee.

Beatrice: Well, then God forgive me!

But there's something important here

that you won't find
mentioned in the Playbill.

Something we hardly ever notice:

the stage.

It's an absolutely vital
part of the show,

and yet most of us, we don't
even give it a second thought.

But Isaac Newton,

he did.

This is how the father of modern
science pictured space:

as an empty stage.

To Newton, space was the framework for
everything that happens in the cosmos,

the arena within which the drama
of the universe plays out.

And Newton's stage was passive:

absolute, eternal and unchanging.

The action couldn't affect the stage,

and the stage couldn't
affect the action.

By picturing space in this way,

Newton was able to describe the world
as no one had ever done before.

His unchanging stage
allowed him to understand

almost all motion we can see around us,

yielding laws that can
predict everything

from the way apples fall from trees

to the path the Earth
takes around the Sun.

These laws worked so well that we still
use them for the things we do today,

from launching satellites

to landing airplanes.

And the laws all hinge
on one radical idea:

space is real.

Even though you can't see it,
or smell it or touch it,

space is enough of a real, physical
thing to provide a benchmark

for certain kinds of motion,

like that skater.

Newton would say that when she spins,

her arms splay out because she is
spinning with respect to something,

and that something is space itself.

Philosophers had been debating the
nature of space for a very long time.

What Newton does is change
the terms of the debate,

and with that, essentially,
modern science gets born.

Newton's stage was a huge hit.

It enjoyed the limelight
for over 200 years.

But in the early decades
of the 20th century,

a new set of ideas emerged that shook
Newton's stage to its very foundations,

ideas put forward by a young clerk,
working in a Swiss patent office.

His name?

Albert Einstein.

Einstein grew up in the late 1800s, at
the dawn of the age of electricity.

Electric power was lighting up cities,

giving rise to all kinds of technologies
Newton could never have imagined.

All of these developments
tapped into something

that had captivated Einstein
since he was a child:

light.

Not light bulbs and street lamps,

but the very nature of light itself.

And it was his fascination with one
particularly weird feature of light,

its speed, that would lead Einstein to
overturn Newton's picture of space.

To see how, let's take a ride.

Right now, we're traveling at
about 20 miles per hour.

To go faster, all the driver
needs to do is step on the gas,

and the cab's speed changes.

Now, you can feel that change,

but you can also see it on
the cab's speedometer,

or one of those radar speed signs.

Okay, you can slow it down now.

But now imagine that instead of
measuring the speed of the cab,

you have a radar sign
that measures the speed

of the light coming off its headlights.

That sign would measure the light
traveling at an astounding

671,000,000 miles an hour.

Now, when the cab starts moving,

you'd think that the speed of the light

would increase by the
same amount as the car.

After all, you'd think that the moving
cab would give the light an extra push.

But surprisingly, that's
not what happens.

Our radar sign, or any
measurement of light's speed,

will always detect light traveling
at 671,000,000 miles per hour,

whether the cab is moving or not.

But how could this be?

How could all measurements of light's
speed always come out the same?

If you're running at a wall,
it's coming at you faster

than if you're standing still
with respect to that wall.

But that's not true with light.

The speed of light is
the same for everybody.

That's really extraordinary.

So, here's how Einstein made sense
of this extraordinary puzzle:

knowing that speed is just
a measure of the space

that something travels over time,

Einstein proposed a truly stunning idea:

that space and time could work together,

constantly adjusting by
exactly the right amount,

so that no matter how fast
you might be moving

when you measure the speed of light,

it always comes out to be
671,000,000 miles per hour.

To respect that absolute
quality about light,

time had to cease to be absolute.
Space had to cease to be absolute.

And those two had to become relative

in such a way that they
slosh between each other.

If space and time being
flexible sounds unfamiliar,

it's only because we
don't move fast enough

in everyday life to see it in action.

But if this cab could move
near the speed of light,

the effects would no longer be hidden.

For example, if you were
on a street corner

as I went by close to
the speed of light,

you'd see space adjusting,
so that my cab,

it would appear just inches long,

and you'd also hear my watch
ticking off time very slowly.

But from my perspective inside the cab,
my watch would be ticking normally.

and space, in here, would
appear as it always does.

But when I look outside the cab,
I'd see space wildly adjusting,

all to keep the speed of light constant.

So, with Einstein, time and space
are no longer rigid and absolute.

Instead, they meld together with motion,

forming a single entity that
came to be called "spacetime."

I think, as we live our life every day,

we live with a Newtonian
picture of space and time.

It's something that we
are comfortable with.

But Einstein was able to
make reason conquer sense.

That really was the genius of Einstein.

This notion that space
and time are a unity.

To me is one of the greatest insights
that has ever occurred in science.

It's so counterintuitive to everything
we've ever experienced as human beings.

And in the hands of Albert Einstein,

this new picture of space
would solve a deep mystery

having to do with the most
familiar force in the cosmos:

gravity.

Newton knew that gravity is a force
that attracts objects to each other.

And his laws predicted the strength of
this force with fantastic precision.

But how does gravity actually work?

How does the Earth pull on the moon

across hundreds of thousands
of miles of empty space?

They behave as if they are connected
by some kind of invisible rope,

but everyone knew that wasn't true,

and Newton's laws provided
no explanation.

Einstein found that no band-aid
patches would fix Newtonian gravity.

He had to invent the mechanism
for it; he had to understand it.

After puzzling over this problem
for more than 10 years,

Einstein reached a startling conclusion:

the secret to gravity lays in
the nature of spacetime.

It was even more flexible than
he had previously realized.

It could stretch, like an actual fabric.

This was a truly radical
break from Newton.

Think of this table as spacetime,

and think of these balls
as objects in space.

Now, if spacetime were nice and flat,
like the surface of this table,

objects would travel in straight lines.

But if space is like a fabric
that can stretch and bend,

well, this may seem a little strange,

but watch what happens

if I put something heavy on
stretchy spacetime fabric.

Now if I take my shot again,

the ball travels along an indentation

in the fabric that the
heavier object creates.

And this, Einstein realized, is
how gravity actually works.

It's the warping of spacetime
caused by the objects within it.

In other words:

gravity is the shape
of spacetime itself.

The moon is kept in orbit,

not because it's pulled to the
Earth by some mysterious force,

but rather because it
rolls along a curve

in the spacetime fabric
that the Earth creates.

With Einstein, space became
not only real, but flexible.

So suddenly space had properties,
suddenly space had curvature.

Suddenly space had a
flexible kind of geometry,

almost like a rubber sheet.

It opens up a whole new way
of thinking about reality

that describes the entire universe.

Einstein becomes Einstein
because of that observation.

Where Newton saw space as passive,
Einstein saw it as dynamic:

it's interwoven with time and
it dictates how things move.

So, after Einstein, space can no longer
be thought of as a static stage.

It's an actor, and it plays a
leading role in the cosmic drama.

Now, it's one thing to
think of space as dynamic,

active and flexible, like a fabric.

But is it really? Is
this just a metaphor?

Or does it actually
describe what space is?

Well, Einstein's theory predicts
that one way to find out

would be to take a little journey
to the edge of a black hole.

Black holes are collapsed stars,

massive objects crushed to a
fraction of their original size.

Gravity around them is so strong
that according to Einstein's math,

a spinning black hole can literally
drag space along with it,

twisting it like an
actual piece of cloth.

The nearest black hole is
trillions of miles away,

making it a challenge to
test this prediction.

But in the late 1950s, a
physicist named Leonard Schiff

began searching for a way to test
Einstein's ideas about space

much closer to home.

Schiff was inspired by something we
usually think of as a child's toy:

a gyroscope.

He thought that if space
really twists like a fabric,

a gyroscope might allow
him to detect it.

It was a strange idea,

and he chose a strange place
to share it with the world:

the faculty swimming pool at Stanford.

Here, in 1959, Schiff met
with two colleagues,

William Fairbank and Bob Cannon.

He was excited about an ad he'd
seen for a high-tech gyroscope.

Though it looked different, it basically
worked the same as the child's toy.

Then and there, the three decided
to launch a device like this

into orbit around the Earth.

Normally, a gyroscope's axis
points in a fixed direction.

But if Earth is actually dragging space,

then the gyroscope's axis would
be dragged along with it,

shifting its orientation in a
way that could be measured.

It was a brilliantly simple plan.

There was just one problem:

Einstein's theories predict that

the Earth's rotation twists
space by only a tiny amount,

an amount so small, it would be like
trying to measure the height of a penny

from 62 miles away.

The team spent more than two
years trying to figure out

how to make such a precise measurement.

They finally devised a plan to attach
four freely-floating gyroscopes

to a telescope aimed at a distant star.

If space twists, then over time

the gyroscopes would no
longer point at the star,

since they'd get caught up
in the swirl of space.

And in 1962, they applied
to NASA for a grant,

requesting around a million dollars

for what would come to be
called "Gravity Probe B."

Members of the team originally thought

the project would take
about three years.

They were just a little optimistic.

With an ever-growing team,
Gravity Probe B became

one of the longest-running
experiments in history.

Decade after decade was spent trying
to realize the original vision,

which meant launching a telescope
into space and building gyroscopes

that were among the smoothest
objects ever created.

The technology is just frightening.

It was like the carrot on
the front of the mule.

It was like it was always five to ten
years away when we could do this.

And it was five to ten years
away for about 35 years.

Consuming more than four decades
and 750,000,000 dollars,

the project was nearly
cancelled by NASA nine times.

Finally, in April of 2004, the team
gathered to witness the launch.

Of the three men who sat by
the pool back in 1959,

only one was alive to see it.

And there we were watching.

It's a terribly exciting
moment in your life,

just a thrilling experience.

It was flawless. 10,000
things did not go wrong.

For over a year, Gravity
Probe B orbited the Earth,

while the team nervously
monitored its every move,

trying to see if the Earth
would actually twist space.

Finally, the data began to trickle in,

and there was a problem:

the gyroscopes were experiencing
a tiny, unexpected wobble,

and to clean up the data
would cost millions.

With funds running out, it looked
like nearly half a century of work

was about to go down the drain.

Then, at almost the
last possible moment,

two sources of additional
funding emerged:

the son of original team leader William
Fairbank, who made a private donation;

and Turki al-Saud,

a member of the Saudi royal family with
a degree in aeronautics from Stanford,

who arranged for a large grant.

Over the next two years, the
problem with the data was solved,

revealing that the axes of
the gyroscopes shifted by

almost exactly the amount predicted
by Einstein's equations.

I think it's the first time that you
can actually see Einstein's effect,

this drift, with a naked eye.

This experiment provides the most
direct evidence ever found

that space is something real,

a physical entity, like a fabric.

After all, if space were nothing,
there would nothing to twist.

But at the same time
that Albert Einstein

was investigating space on
the largest of scales,

another band of physicists was probing
the universe on extremely tiny scales.

And there they found a
completely uncharted realm,

for Einstein's picture of space
it was nowhere to be found.

To see what I'm talking about,

imagine you could shrink billions of
times smaller than your current size.

This is the realm of atoms
and subatomic particles,

the fundamental building blocks
of everything we can see.

And when you get down to this size,

the world plays by a wildly
different set of rules,

called "quantum mechanics".

According to these rules,

even if you try to remove
every last atom and particle,

you'd find that empty space
is still far from empty.

In fact, it's teeming with activity:

particles are constantly popping
in and out of existence.

They erupt out of nothingness, quickly
annihilate each other and disappear.

In quantum mechanics, empty
space is not that empty; it's

full of fluctuating fields, full of
all sorts of jittery things going on.

It's a place where particles
are constantly

fluctuating and annihilating each other

and being created again
and annihilating.

It's a place of chaos and bubbling.

While the theory predicted this,

it wasn't until 1948 that a
scientist named Hendrik Casimir

suggested that even though we
can't see these particles,

they should cause empty space
to do something we can see.

He predicted that if you take
two ordinary metal plates

and place them extremely close together,

say, closer together than the
thickness of a sheet of paper,

then particles with certain energies
would be excluded because,

in some sense, they wouldn't
fit between the plates.

With more of this frenetic activity
outside the plates than inside,

Casimir thought the plates
would be pushed together

by what we usually think of
as empty space.

And some years later, when
the experiment was done,

Casimir was proven right.

In empty space, the plates
were pushed together.

So, on atomic scales,
empty space is not empty;

it's so flooded with activity that
it can force objects to move.

And today, the quest to understand space
on the smallest scale is continuing

with one of the most expensive
science experiments in history.

This is CERN, the European Organization
for Nuclear Research, in Geneva.

And here, buried a few hundred
feet below the ground,

is the Large Hadron Collider, the
world's most powerful accelerator.

With a price tag of about $10 billion,

it accelerates subatomic particles to
more than 99.99 % of the speed of light

and smashes them into each other.

In the showers of debris
produced by these collisions,

scientists at places like
this have discovered

a whole zoo of strange
and exotic particles.

And right now, they are chasing
one of the most elusive:

a particle thought to be
essential to shaping everything

from the atoms in our bodies

to the most distant stars.

If this particle is found, it will
redefine our picture of space

and fulfill a quest begun
more than 40 years ago.

It all started in 1964,

when a young English physicist
named Peter Higgs

suggested something about space that
was so radical it nearly ruined him.

I was told that I was talking
nonsense, that I couldn't be right.

So they clearly hadn't
understood what I was saying.

Higgs and a few others were wrestling
with a puzzle which comes down to this:

the fundamental particles
in the universe

all contain different amount of mass,

which we usually think of as weight.

Without mass, these particles would
never combine to form the familiar atoms

that make up all the stuff we
see in the world around us.

But what creates mass?

And why do different particles
have different masses?

Try as they might, no one had been able
answer this perplexing question.

Then, one weekend, after a walk outside
Edinburgh, Higgs had a peculiar idea.

Using mathematics, he imagined space in
a new way, as something like an ocean.

Particles are immersed in this ocean,
and gain mass as they move through it.

To see how this works, think of a
particle's mass like an actor's fame,

and the Higgs ocean is
like the paparazzi:

some particles, like unknown
actors, pass through with ease;

the paparazzi simply aren't
interested in them.

But other particles, like
superstars, have to push and press.

And the more those particles
struggle to get through,

the more they interact with the
ocean, and the more mass they gain.

Higgs was convinced he'd
made a great discovery.

But when he submitted his idea to a
journal at CERN, it was rejected.

Undaunted, Higgs honed
his theory further,

until he was offered the chance to
present it at Einstein's old haunt:

the Institute for Advanced
Study, in Princeton.

There, he expected his new idea would
meet some of its toughest critics.

I was happily driving up the freeway,

and then there was a sign
to turn off for Princeton,

and that really confronted me
with what I was going into.

I broke out in a cold sweat,
and I started trembling,

and I had to pull off
the road to recover.

But Higgs persevered.

It was the first in a series of talks

that would convince
colleagues far and wide

that he was onto something profound.

Eventually, I sort of wore them down.

I felt I had sort of triumphed,

so I enjoyed the parties which followed.

Today, the idea Higgs pioneered,
called the Higgs Field,

is crucial to our
understanding of space.

The Higgs Field is everywhere.

It's something that even in the emptiest
vacuum of space has an effect:

it gives you mass.

So I think Higgs actually
deserves credit

for being one of the people that said,

"Space is stuff. It has properties
in it that are intrinsic,

that you can't get rid of.
You can't turn them off."

The only problem? There's no physical
proof that the Higgs Field exists,

at least not yet.

But here at CERN,
scientists are attempting

to smash particles together
with so much energy

that they will knock loose a
piece of the Higgs Field,

producing a tiny particle of its own.

It's as if they're trying to
chip off a piece of space.

We think that if we knock
into space hard enough,

with particle accelerator collisions,

that we can actually make a Higgs
particle come out of empty space.

Our whole understanding of matter as
we now have it would just fall apart,

if the Higgs Field didn't exist.

I don't think anybody seriously
doubts that we will see it.

Certainly, if we don't, that will
be an extremely bizarre outcome.

Finding the Higgs particle
would be a major milestone,

establishing that the emptiest of empty
space has an impact on all of matter.

But it turns out that space
contains an ingredient

far more elusive than anything
Higgs ever imagined,

an ingredient that may hold the key
to the greatest of all mysteries:

the very fate of the cosmos.

It's a mystery that began
some 14 billion years ago,

in what we call the "Big Bang".

In a fraction of a second,

the universe underwent
a violent expansion,

sending space hurtling outward.

Space has been expanding ever since.

For decades, most scientists thought
that expansion must be slowing down,

thanks to the pull of gravity.

When I toss an apple up,
the gravity of the Earth

eventually stops it and brings it back.

And just like the apple
slows down with time,

so too the universe should have been
slowing down in its expansion,

because of the gravitational attraction
of all matter and energy

for all other matter and energy.

But that raised the question:

what is the ultimate fate of the cosmos?
Would space go on expanding forever,

or would gravity eventually
stop space from expanding,

causing it to collapse back on
itself in a "Big Crunch?"

To solve this mystery,
two teams of astronomers

set out to measure the slowing of
the expansion using a novel tool:

exploding stars called supernovas.

So a supernova is a star that ends
its life in a massive explosion.

They're extremely luminous; they can
be as bright as a billion suns.

What makes supernovas great is that
they are very similar when they explode.

They all get to about
the same brightness,

and then they fade away in
just about the same way.

Because the explosions are
so bright and uniform,

the teams reasoned that these supernovas

would act as very precise
cosmic beacons,

allowing them to track how the expansion
of space has slowed over time.

The trouble is supernovas
are extremely rare.

To find enough of them,

Perlmutter spent years calling
astronomers around the globe,

begging for time on their telescopes.

We needed the biggest telescopes in the
world; we needed perfect conditions.

And in those perfect conditions,

I would be calling people up
at the middle of their night

when they're trying to do some
serious work, and I'd be saying

"I know that you have a very busy
schedule but, by any chance,

if you could just squeeze in
this half hour observation,

it would really be very
interesting to us."

When they finally had
enough data to chart

how much the pull of gravity was
slowing the expansion of the universe,

they were in for a surprise.

The results looked a little bit strange.

They didn't really show any slowing of
the universe at all; very surprising,

Actually, a universe that's
actually speeding up.

It was as though space, which
we really thought was nothing,

actually had an inherent
springiness to it.

And so space did not
want to be compressed,

space actually wants to
push the universe apart.

It looked like the universe was
expanding faster and faster with time,

accelerating rather than decelerating.

My immediate response was

"I have to figure out why this is
wrong. This can't be right!"

But it was right.

And most scientists converged
on one explanation:

there's something that fills
space and counteracts

the pull of ordinary attractive gravity,

pushing galaxies apart and stretching
the very fabric of the cosmos.

This mysterious substance filling
space has been dubbed "dark energy",

and it's turned our picture of
the universe upside down.

Over the largest distances, dark energy
dominates the contents of the universe,

and we don't know what it is.

If you do sort of a survey, a census
of all the energy in the universe,

dark energy turns out to be
about 70 % of the universe.

And up until a decade ago, nobody
imagined such stuff even existed.

So, in essence, the weight
of empty space itself

is 70 % of the weight of
the entire universe.

That's roughly the same percentage of
Earth's surface that's covered by water.

Imagine we didn't know what water is;
that's where we stand with dark energy.

We're really clueless
about how to explain it.

We have all of this fancy
scientific apparatus

of quantum mechanics and
relativity and particle physics

that we've developed in
the last hundred years,

and none of that works to
explain dark energy.

And the discovery of dark
energy held another surprise:

the idea that the universe
contains such an ingredient

had actually been cooked
up 80 years earlier.

I'll let you in on a little secret:

although he didn't call it dark energy,

long ago Albert Einstein predicted
that space itself could exert a force

that would drive galaxies apart.

You see, shortly after discovering
his General Theory of Relativity,

his theory of gravity,

Einstein found that, according
to the mathematics,

the universe would either be

expanding

or

contracting

but it couldn't hover at a fixed size.

This was puzzling because before
they knew about the Big Bang,

most scientists, including Einstein,
pictured the universe as static;

eternal and unchanging.

When Einstein's equations suggested
an expanding or contracting universe,

not the static universe everyone
believed in, he had a problem.

So Einstein went back to his
equations and modified them

to allow for a kind of anti-gravity

that would infuse space
with an outward push,

counteracting the usual
inward pull of gravity,

allowing the universe to stand still.

He called the modification
the "cosmological constant".

Adding the cosmological constant
rescued his equations,

but the truth is Einstein had
no idea if this outward push,

or anti-gravity, really existed.

The introduction of the
cosmological constant by Einstein

was not a very elegant solution to
try to find what he was looking for,

a stationary universe.

It achieves this effect of anti-gravity.

It says that gravity sometimes
can behave in such a way,

not to pull things together,
but to push things apart.

Like the clash of two titans,

the cosmological constant and
the pull of ordinary matter

could hold the universe in
check and keep it static.

But about a dozen years later,

the astronomer Edwin Hubble
discovered the universe is not static.

It's expanding due to the explosive
force of the Big Bang,

14-billion years ago.

That meant Einstein's original
equations no longer had to be altered,

and so, suddenly,

the need for a cosmological constant
went right out the window.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

Einstein is said to have called
this his biggest blunder.

But here's the thing:

with the recent discovery that the ex-
pansion of the universe is accelerating,

scientists are convinced that
there is something in space

that is pushing things apart.

So, 70 years later,
Einstein's biggest blunder

may rank among his greatest insights.

It was something that nobody
else was thinking about,

but it might be that Einstein's
cosmological constant is the key

to understanding the expansion of
the universe as we see it today.

Though no one knows what
dark energy actually is,

it raises an astounding and
troubling possibility:

Einstein pictured the strength of
his anti-gravity as "constant".

But is the strength of
dark energy constant?

And what if it changes over time?

The answer could overturn
everything we thought we knew

about the fate of the cosmos.

At the moment, everything in our world,

from the molecules making up my body
to the molecules making up the Moon,

is held together by forces
that overwhelm

the outward push of dark energy,

and that's why we don't see things
expanding in our everyday lives.

But that situation might
not last forever.

In one scenario, dark energy will
continue to push the galaxies

farther and farther apart,

until ultimately they'd
be pushed so far apart

that the universe would become
a cold, dark and lonely place.

In another scenario, the strength of
dark energy might increase over time,

becoming so strong that it would tear
apart everything within the galaxies,

from stars

to planets

to matter of all kinds.

If the dark energy grows with time,

then, ultimately, even atoms
will get ripped apart,

when there's enough dark energy
between the nuclei and the electrons

to rip space apart,

the "Big Rip."

Our picture of space has gone
through a remarkable transformation.

Back in Newton's time,

space was just the container.
It didn't do anything at all.

Then, through Einstein, space begins
to affect how objects move.

Then, with Casimir, literally,

objects can be pushed by the
activity even in empty space.

And now through the ideas
of Higgs and dark energy,

the very expansion of the universe

may be coming from the energy
of empty space itself.

I don't think anybody would have
thought space would have this kind of

rich and profound impact on
the nature of reality.

But as far as we've come,
the journey that begun with

Isaac Newton's picture of space
as something like a stage

is not yet finished.

As we examine the fabric of
the cosmos ever more closely,

we may well find far more surprises
than anyone ever imagined.

Take me, for example.

I seem real enough, don't I?

Well, yes.

But surprising new clues are
emerging that everything,

you and I, and even space,
itself, may actually be

a kind of hologram.

That is, everything we
see and experience,

everything we call our familiar
3-dimensional reality,

may be a projection

of information that's stored on a thin,
distant two-dimensional surface,

sort of the way the information
for this hologram is stored

on this thin piece of plastic.

Now, holograms are something
we're all familiar with

from the security symbol you
find on most credit cards.

But the universe as a hologram?

That's one of the most drastic
revisions to our picture of space

and reality ever proposed.

And the evidence for it comes from
some of the strangest realms of space:

black holes.

This is a real disconnect and it's
very hard to get your head around.

Modern ideas, coming from black holes,
tell us that reality is two-dimensional,

that the three-dimensional world, the
full-bodied three-dimensional world,

is a kind of image of a hologram

on the boundary on the region of space.

This is a very strange thing.

When I was a younger physicist
I would have thought

any physicist who said that
was absolutely crazy.

Here's a way to think about this.

Imagine I took my wallet and
threw it into a black hole.

What would happen?

We used to think that since
nothing, not even light,

can escape the immense
gravity of a black hole,

my wallet would be lost forever,

but it now seems that may
not be the whole story.

Recently, scientists exploring
the math describing black holes

made a curious discovery.

Even as my wallet disappears
into the black hole,

a copy of all the
information it contains

seems to get smeared out and stored
on the surface of the black hole,

in much the same way that
information is stored in a computer.

So, in the end, my wallet
exists in two places:

there's a 3-dimensional version that's
lost forever inside the black hole

and a two-dimensional version that
remains on the surface as information.

The information content of all the
stuff that fell into that black hole

can be expressed entirely in terms of
just the outside of the black hole.

The idea, then, is that you can capture
what's going on inside the black hole

by referring only to the outside.

And in theory,

I could use the information on
the outside of the black hole

to reconstruct my wallet.

And here's the truly mind-blowing part:

space within a black hole
plays by the same rules

as space outside a black
hole or anywhere else.

So, if an object inside a black hole

can be described by information
on the black hole's surface,

then it might be that
everything in the universe,

from galaxies and stars to you
and me, even space itself,

is just a projection of
information stored

on some distant two-dimensional
surface that surrounds us.

In other words,

what we experience as reality
may be something like a hologram.

Is the three-dimensional
world an illusion

in the same sense that a
hologram is an illusion?

Perhaps.

I think I'm inclined to think yes,

that the three-dimensional
world is a kind of illusion

and that the ultimate precise reality

is the two-dimensional reality at
the surface of the universe.

This idea is so new that physicists
are still struggling to understand it.

But if it's right,

just as Newton and Einstein completely
changed our picture of space,

we may be on the verge of an
even more dramatic revolution.

For something that's such a
vital part of our everyday lives,

space remains kind of
like a familiar stranger.

It's all around us

but we're still far from having
unmasked its true identity.

That may take a hundred years,
it may take a thousand years,

or it may happen tomorrow, but
when we solve that mystery,

we'll take a giant step toward fully
understanding the fabric of the cosmos.
