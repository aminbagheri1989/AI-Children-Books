Introduction
Are you having trouble      with reading comprehension questions on 
tests? Do you want to know how to improve your reading ability or pass 
placement tests in school or work? If so, then this book is for you. Read on 
to ind out why.
Maybe you already like to read and want to use this book to sharpen 
your skills for an important test. If so, that’s ine. In fact, you can skip 
this part of the Introduction—or skip the Introduction entirely—and go 
straight to the questions.
But maybe you’re one of the millions of people who have trouble with 
reading, especially with reading carefully while reading quickly. If so, this 
Introduction will give you some direction.
First, know that you’re not alone. It’s a fact that some people relate more 
easily to numbers or to working with their hands. Still, no other general skill 
is used more regularly—in work, play, and just plain living—than reading. 
The good news is that reading well is a skill that can be developed with prac-
tice. This book will help, but something else will help even more: If you’re 
serious  about  developing  your  reading  comprehension  skills,  go  to  the 
library or a bookstore and pick out books on subjects you ind fascinating.
For instance, if your interests are in skydiving, biking, golf, scuba diving, 
race cars, camping, woodworking, or even the stock market, use that as a

starting point, and choose a book. The subject will undoubtedly draw you 
in because you are already interested. Begin to read. You will ind that as 
you focus on the subject matter, you will already know some of the infor-
mation. But chances are you will discover something new as you read, and 
you can connect this with your prior knowledge. Eventually, your store of 
information becomes quite admirable. Repeat the process over and over 
again. As you do, you will improve your reading comprehension skills, and 
it won’t even seem like a chore.
A Look at Our Book
The irst ive sections cover the basics—from vocabulary to topic sentences.   
501 Reading Comprehension Questions, 4th Edition   begins with vocabulary 
because that’s what you need to read—the essential building blocks. You 
will ind vocabulary questions that test your ability to ind deinitions and 
context clues. Next, the analogy questions take you a step further. When 
answering analogy questions, you will learn to develop your ability to 
compare and contrast, ind similarities and differences, and relate parts 
to whole pieces. Just in case you’re wondering why this is important, you 
should know that the skills you develop from these short exercises in word 
play will assist you when you are reading longer passages. 
As the book progresses, you will be asked to read short, interesting para-
graphs to ind main ideas and topic sentences. Once you are comfortable 
with these basic skills, proceed to the passages in the last ive sections. This 
is where you will use your skills to tackle longer passages.
The last ive sections begin with one- to two-paragraph passages. Ques-
tions following these passages ask you to identify details and facts, choose 
the main idea, make inferences, or analyze and interpret the text. The 
passages, both iction and noniction, get longer as you progress through 
the book, and they all have varied subjects.
Some are about computers, geology, or geography, while others are about 
poems, philosophy, literature, or art. You will even ind some charts and 
graphs. You may want to take notes as you read. This technique of interact-
ing with the text is good to use anytime you read or when you take a test that 
includes reading comprehension.
The answers to every question are at the back of the book. Each answer 
is fully explained, so if you have trouble with a particular question, you will 
be able to igure out how to arrive at the correct answer.

How to Use Our Book
This book is best used to build your critical reading and thinking skills, 
but you might want to support it with some other LearningExpress Skill 
Builders books. When it comes to perfecting your reading comprehension, 
don’t ignore any of the other language skills. You will ind   Writing Skills 
Success in 20 Minutes a Day, Vocabulary and Spelling Success in 20 Minutes a 
Day, 501 Logic and Reasoning Problems,   and   1001 Vocabulary and Spelling 
Questions   to be indispensable guides. In any case, the more you use the 
language and understand the building blocks, the easier and faster you will 
breeze through those reading comprehension passages that you ind on 
most tests.
Working on Your Own
If you are working alone to brush up on the basics and prepare for a test in 
connection with a job or school, you will want to develop a time schedule 
and know your learning style. Since everyone reads differently, the number 
of words or pages you can cover in a given time period may be more or less 
than one section of this book. That’s okay. Just spend 20 minutes—more 
or less—reading the material and going through the exercises. Don’t worry 
about how much material you’re covering. It’s important that you’re prac-
ticing, and chances are that your speed will improve as you go through the 
book. Your job is to ind your pace.
Then, know your learning style. Do you learn best in a quiet room, or 
do you need music in the background? Whatever the case may be, ind the 
location that best suits you. Do you need to take notes to remember facts 
and details? Have a pen, pencil, highlighter, and notebook ready. Are you 
at your best early in the morning or late at night? Pick the best time, get 
comfortable, and begin.
Tutoring Others
501 Reading Comprehension Questions, 4th Edition   will work well in combina-
tion with almost any basic reading or English text. You will probably ind it 
most helpful to give your student(s) a brief lesson on the topic (main idea, 
fact/detail, inference, etc.), and then have them spend the remainder of the 
class or session reading the passages and answering the questions. When 
you inish, take some time for a brief review session.

Stress the importance of learning by doing. Carry a book into class or 
work and talk about what you’ve read so far. Let people know that reading 
is enjoyable, and they may just use you as a role model!
Suggested Reading List
This section wouldn’t be complete without a list of some great books to 
read. Reading about reading and answering test questions is ine, but the 
best way to improve your reading ability is to read. This list is compiled 
by category. Help yourself. Choose one from the list, pick it up at a local 
bookstore or library, open the cover, and enjoy.

Vocabulary
Understanding the words used      to construct sentences is the best 
way to begin practicing for a reading comprehension test. Using a diction-
ary is, of course, the best way to deine a word. Get into the habit of using 
a dictionary as you work through this book. Make it part of your basic study 
materials, and keep it right beside you as you go through this book. 
But if you’re in a testing situation and you are not allowed to use one, 
rely on the context clues in the sentence. The term   context clues   means that 
other words in the sentence “give away” or give clues to the deinition. For 
example, sometimes you will ind synonyms (words that mean the same 
thing) or antonyms (words that mean the opposite), or details that lead you 
to identify the vocabulary word in question. Once in a while, you will ind a 
group of words set off by commas (called an appositive), which gives you a 
very clear deinition of the word.
COntext
The words, phrases, and sentences surrounding an unfamiliar 
word. The context can help you make an educated guess about 
a new word or phrase.

Analogies
The dictionary deines an        analogy   as a “similarity in some respects 
between things that are otherwise dissimilar.” In each of the questions 
contained in this section, you will ind a pair of related words. These words 
are separated by a colon, like this:
ish : scales
Read that to yourself as if the colon were the words “is to”—“ish       is to
scales.” Then, as you read through the possible answers, add “as” to the begin-
ning of each answer—“ish is to scales  horse is to barn,” and so forth.  as 
Look at those words and try to igure out how they are connected to 
one another. For example, what is the connection between the words   ish   
and   scales  ? Obviously, a ish is covered with scales; now think of two other 
analOgY
Comparing two things that are not related in order to ind simi-
larities. “A ish is covered with scales, as a bird is covered with 
feathers.”

words that share a similar relationship. A good example of this would be 
bird   and   feathers  . The similarity between these two unrelated pairs of words

ind another pair in the choices that would it into that same sentence. A 
ish   is covered with   scales, as a bird   is covered with   feathers.

Main Ideas, 
Themes
Finding the   main idea   or   theme   of a written piece is one of the most 
important aspects of good reading comprehension. It is, however, easy to 
confuse the   main idea   or   theme   with the   subject  . Basically, the   subject   of a 
piece of writing is what that piece is   generally   about, plain and simple—the 
facts and information. However, when you look past the facts and informa-
tion to the heart of what writers are trying to say, and why they are saying 
it, that’s the main idea or theme. For example, the subject of this introduc-
tion is about distinguishing between a subject and a main idea or theme; 
the main idea or theme is why it’s important to be able to recognize that 
difference. The main idea is the point that the writer is trying to help the 
reader understand, whereas the topic is what the writer is using to get a 
main ideas across.

What  the  passage  is  about—who  or  what  is  being  discussed

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
   Answers
101.   d.    The passage speaks speciically about onions and bay leaves in 
clam chowder—not about soups in general, and thus choice     b
is not correct. No mention is made to nutrition or poison, nor 
does the passage address over-cooked clams.
   102.   b.    The last sentence in the paragraph clearly supports the idea that 
the renewed interest in Shakespeare is due to the development 
of his characters. Choice   is incorrect because the writer never   a
makes this type of comparison. Choice   is wrong, because even   c
though scholars are mentioned in the paragraph, there is no in-
dication that the scholars are compiling the anthology. Choice 
d   is wrong because there is no support to show that most New 
Yorkers are interested in this work. There is no support for 
choice  .  e
   103.   d.    This answer is implied by the whole paragraph. The author 
stresses the need to read critically by performing operations 
on the text in a slow and speciic manner. Choice   is incorrect   a
because the author never says that reading is dull. Choices  , ,   b  c
and   are not supported by the paragraph.  e
   104.   a.     The support for this choice is in the second sentence, which 
states that in some countries, toxic insecticides are still legal. 
Choice   is incorrect because even though polar regions are   b
mentioned in the paragraph, there is no support for the idea 
that warmer regions are not just as affected. There is no support   
for choice  . Choice   can be ruled out because there is nothing   c  d
to indicate that DDT and toxaphene are the most toxic. Choice 
e   is illogical.
   105.   a.     The second and third sentence combine to give support to 
choice  . The statement stresses that there must be a judge’s   a
approval (i.e., legal authorization) before a search can be con-
ducted. Choices   and   are wrong because it is not enough   b  d
for the police to have direct evidence or a reasonable belief—a 
judge must authorize the search for it to be legal. Choices   and   c
e   are not mentioned in the passage.

   106.   e.    This answer is clearly stated in the last sentence of the para-
graph. Choice   can be ruled out because there is no support   a
to show that studying math is dangerous. Words are not men-
tioned in the passage, which rules out choice  . There is no   b
support for choice  . Choice   is a contradiction to the infor-  c  d
mation in the passage. 
   107.   d.    The passage addresses the fact that a red ilter could remove 
some blue light in black and white photography, so choice   is   d
best. No mention is made of infrared light or of the popularity 
of black-and-white photography, and choice   is the exact op-  e
posite of what the passage states.
   108.   d.    Choices   and   are not supported by the paragraph. Choices     a  c  b
and   only tell us about particular parts of the paragraph and are   e
too speciic to be the main idea. Choice  , however, is general   d
enough to encompass all the sentences and the paragraph as a 
whole. Every sentence supports the idea asserted in choice  .   d
   109.   d.    Both sentences in the paragraph support this choice. Choices     a
and   are opinions and are not in the paragraph. Choices   and   e  b
c   may be true, but they are also not supported by the paragraph.
   110.   c.     The passage cautions against overwinding, stating that it can 
break the clock’s main spring. From this, one can infer that the 
clock is run by a spring. The other choices may or may not be 
true, but they are not addressed in the passage.

Topic Sentences
In the last section,   you learned what a main idea is. Often, writers 
express their main idea in a clearly deined sentence known as a   topic sentence  . 
Topic sentences are usually found at the beginning of a paragraph in order 
to immediately establish the main idea. But this is not always the case—
topic sentences can be found anywhere in a paragraph, and sometimes, the 
author chooses not to use one at all. Still, looking for the topic sentence is a 
good skill to have when ferreting out the meaning of a reading passage.
tOpiC

Short Passages
In this section, you   will ind short passages (one and two paragraph), 
accompanied by questions that ask you to identify explicit information, 
analyze, and interpret what is written. This is your irst chance to use 
everything you’ve learned so far. Pay special attention to the details and 
the facts, and make a habit of trying to identify the author’s main idea; 
also, try to think of the author’s motive for writing the passage. Ask the 
questions, “  Who? What? When? Where? How?   and   Why?  ” Is the author’s 
purpose to inform you of facts, persuade you of something, or simply to 
entertain you?
As you read, try marking up the passages or taking notes. The more 
active a reader you are, the more likely that you will understand and fully 
enjoy what you read.
inferenCe
Using information that is stated in a passage to draw a conclusion 
that is   not   stated. For example, “The furry animal sat in her master’s 
lap, purring contently.”
You might conclude that the “furry animal” is a cat, given the 
information—and that would be an inference.

The answers to this section begin on page 79.
Some of the questions following the passages ask you to make   inferences   
from the passages. To   infer   means to arrive at a conclusion by reasoning 
from evidence. Synonyms for   infer   are   deduce judge  ,   , or   conclude  . If you are 
told to   infer   something from a passage, you are basically being asked what 
conclusions can be drawn from the content of the story. Tip: If you replace 
the word   infer   with   conclude   in a question, it may make more sense to you.
In cities throughout the country, there is a new direction in local

The entire low-carbohydrate versus low-fat diet argument is so 
prevalent that one would think that these are the only two options

Many animals hibernate during parts of the year, entering a state that 
is similar to a very deep sleep. But hibernation is more than simply 
a deep sleep. The animal’s body temperature drops well below its 
normal range, the animal does not wake up for a long period of time, 
and its metabolism slows to the point that the animal does not need 
to eat or relieve itself during that period.
In order to prepare for hibernation, the animal must build up 
its body weight and increase its body fat. This is important, since 
the animal will be living off its own body fat during the months of 
hibernation. Of course, once the period of hibernation is over, the 
animal “wakes up” to ind itself slim and trim once again!
   140.    How does an animal prepare for hibernation?

Whether you can accomplish a speciic goal or meet a speciic dead-
line depends irst on how much time you need to get the job done. 
What should you do when the demands of the job exceed the time 
you have available? The best approach is to divide the project into 
smaller pieces. Different goals will have to be divided in different 
ways, but one seemingly unrealistic goal can often be accomplished 
by working on several smaller, more reasonable goals.
  151.    The main idea of the passage is that
a.   jobs often remain only partially completed because of lack of 
time.
b.   the best way to complete projects is to make sure your goals are

For most judges, sentencing a person who has been convicted of a 
crime is a dificult decision. In the majority of jurisdictions through-
out the country,  judges have few sentencing options from which to 
choose. Generally, their options are conined to a ine, probation, or 
incarceration. Crimes, however, cover a wide spectrum of criminal 
behavior and motivation, and a wide variety of sanctions should be 
available.

Passages in this section can have one to six questions following. You must 
respond accordingly.
Use of electronic mail (e-mail) has been widespread for more than 
a decade. E-mail simpliies the low of ideas, connects people from 
distant ofices, eliminates the need for meetings, and often boosts 
productivity. However, e-mail should be carefully managed to avoid 
unclear and inappropriate communication. E-mail messages should 
be concise and limited to one topic. When complex issues need to be 
addressed, phone calls are still best.
   158.    The main idea of the paragraph is that e-mail
a.   is not always the easiest way to connect people from distant 
ofices.

Native American art often incorporates a language of abstract visual 
symbols. The artist gives a poetic message to the viewer, communi-
cating the beauty of an idea, either by using religious symbols or a 
design from nature such as rain on leaves or sunshine on water. The 
idea communicated may even be purely whimsical, in which case the 
artist might start out with symbols developed from a bird’s tracks or 
a child’s toy.
  160.    The main idea of the passage is that Native American art
a.   is purely poetic and dreamlike.
b.   is usually abstract, although it can also be poetic and beautiful.

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
Complementary and alternative medicine, which includes a 
range of practices outside of conventional medicine such as herbs, 
homeopathy, massage therapy, yoga, and acupuncture, hold increas-
ing appeal for Americans. In fact, according to one estimate, 42% of 
Americans have used alternative therapies. In all age groups, the use 
of unconventional healthcare practices has steadily increased in the 
last 30 years, and the trend is likely to continue, although people born 
before 1945 are the least likely to turn to these therapies.
Why have so many patients turned to alternative therapies? 
Many are frustrated by the time constraints of managed care and 
alienated by conventional medicine’s focus on technology. Others feel 
that a holistic approach to healthcare better relects their beliefs and 
values. Others seek therapies that relieve symptoms associated with 
chronic disease; symptoms that mainstream medicine cannot treat.
Some alternative therapies have even crossed the line into main-
stream medicine, as scientiic investigation has conirmed their safety 
and eficacy. For example, physicians may currently prescribe acu-
puncture for pain management or to control the nausea associated 
with chemotherapy. Additionally, many U.S. medical schools teach 
courses in alternative therapies, and many health insurance compa-
nies offer some alternative medicine beneits.
   166.    What is the main idea of this passage?
a.    Alternative medicine is now a big business in the United States 
with more Americans seeking it out than ever before.
b.   Today, it is not unusual for mainstream doctors to incorporate 
alternative therapies into their practice. 
c.    Over the last few decades, alternative medicine has become 
more popular, accepted, and practiced in the United States.
d.   People are tired of conventional medicine’s focus on technology.
   167.    According to the passage, which practice would not be deined as 
alternative medicine?
a.    pain management

The irst murder ever committed in the United States occurred in 
September 1630, shortly after the Pilgrims arrived in Massachusetts. 
John Billington was the father of two sons, one of the irst to settle 
in the new Plymouth Colony near what is today Boston, and one of 
the people who signed the Maylower Compact—and he was also the 
colony’s irst murderer.
Billington, in fact, was the irst person to commit any crime 
in the colony, as far as we know today. He was also the irst to be 
executed by the state in the New World. Billington’s crime was to 
shoot a man named John Newcomen, for reasons which are lost to 
history.
But Billington’s problems had not begun on the soil of North 
America. He and his sons had nearly caused a mutiny aboard the 
Maylower during the arduous trip across the ocean. One of his 
sons, in fact, ired his gun aboard the Maylower—near an open keg 
of gunpowder! The lash from the gun could easily have ignited the 
powder, which would probably have sunk the ship.
Once  in  Plymouth  Colony,  Billington’s  behavior  did  not 
improve. He refused to serve any form of military duty under the 
leadership of Miles Standish, a duty that was seen by the colonists as 
part of every man’s responsibilities in the New World. He was later 
implicated in a plot to overthrow the entire leadership of Plymouth

Colony, but a lack of evidence prompted the town’s leaders to let 
him go free. 
In the end, Billington’s rebellious and angry nature caught up

Have you ever heard someone sing, “Happy birthday to you . . . 
happy birthday to you . . .”? If so, you are hardly alone—millions 
of people sing that song every year, and the tune is one of the most 
familiar of any song in North America.
Ironically, it is not known who wrote it! The tune was written by 
two sisters, Patty and Mildred Hill, who were school teachers in the 
late 19th century. But their song had different words; instead of “happy 
birthday to you,” the song ran “good morning to all.” The two sisters 
would sing this ditty to their students each morning as school began.
In 1924, the tune was published in a song book, which added 
the “happy birthday” lyrics as verse two. Today, the second verse of 
that song has become one of the best known tunes in the world—and 
nobody knows who wrote the words!
  175.    According to the passage, who wrote the tune to “Happy Birthday”?
a.   two priests
b.   Irving Berlin
c.   Patty and Mildred Hill
d.   It is not known.
  176.    Why is it ironic that the author of the words to “Happy Birthday” 
is not known?
a.   because almost everyone knows the song
b.   because it shows how unjust life can be
c.   because of modern copyright laws
d.   because it was published in 1924

Dogs and cats should never be permitted to eat chocolate, because 
chocolate works like a poison in their bodies. Chocolate contains a 
chemical called theobromine, which is similar to caffeine. Human 
bodies are able to process the theobromine without any ill side 
effects, but dogs and cats cannot. 
Different types of chocolate contain different amounts of theo-
bromine. It would take 20 ounces of milk chocolate to kill a 20-pound 
dog, but only two ounces of baker’s chocolate or six ounces of semi-
sweet chocolate. The amounts, of course, are much smaller for a cat, 
whose body weight is typically less than that of a dog.
Most cats are not naturally attracted to eating chocolate, but 
many dogs are. Dogs by nature will sample nearly anything that they 
see their masters eating, so pet owners must take care to keep all 
chocolate products well out of reach of their dogs and cats.
  179.    According to the passage, why is chocolate poisonous for dogs  
and cats?
a.   It contains caffeine.
b.   Chocolate is made from processed cocoa.
c.   It gets stuck in their intestines.
d.   They cannot process theobromine.
  180.    How much milk chocolate would be poisonous to a cat, according 
to the passage?
a.   substantially less than 20 ounces
b.   substantially more than 20 ounces
c.   approximately one pound
d.   half a Hershey bar
  181.    Why might a dog eat chocolate, according to the passage?
a.   Because it tastes good.
b.   Dogs won’t eat chocolate.
c.   They can smell the theobromine.
d.   Dogs like to imitate their owners.

Theodore Roosevelt was born with asthma and poor eyesight, yet 
this sickly child later won fame as a political leader, a Rough Rider, 
and a hero of the common people. To conquer his handicaps, Teddy 
trained in a gym and became a lightweight boxer at Harvard. Out 
west, he hunted buffalo and ran a cattle ranch. Back east, he became a 
civil service reformer and police commissioner. He became President 
McKinley’s assistant Navy secretary during the Spanish-American 
War.  Also, he led a charge of cavalry Rough Riders up San Juan Hill 
in Cuba. After achieving fame, he became governor of New York and 
went on to become the vice president.
When McKinley was assassinated, Theodore Roosevelt became 
the youngest president at age 42. He is famous for his motto, “Speak 
softly and carry a big stick.” Roosevelt battled for meat inspection 
and pure-food laws. Also, he wanted to save the forests and break the 
grip that big business had on steel and oil. Roosevelt persuaded the 
diplomats of warring Russia and Japan to make peace.

Daylilies are a beautiful perennial lower that can brighten up any 
yard or landscape. They are tolerant of drought and looding, immune 
to heat stress, and grow well in full sun or light shade. They are the 
perfect choice for just about any soil or climate condition.
Different varieties of daylilies can be in bloom from late spring 
until autumn. Individual lowers last only one day, but each plant 
produces many buds, and many varieties have more than one lower-
ing period. 
Daylilies grow best in soil that is slightly acidic, and they prefer 
either direct sunshine or light shade. The best time to plant them is 
in the early fall or early spring, but they are hardy enough to endure 
planting or transplanting at almost any time of year. They should be 
planted 18 to 24 inches apart, and the bulb should be no deeper than 
one inch below the soil’s surface.

Indians inhabited all the islands of the West Indies and were a peace-
ful people living under the guidance of their chiefs. Three hundred 
years after the Arawaks irst arrived on St. Maarten, in the 1300s, 
they were defeated and forced to abandon the island by a hostile tribe 
of Indians originating in South America. This new tribe was called 
the Carib. The Caribbean Sea was named after them. Unlike the 
Arawaks, they had no permanent chiefs or leaders, except in times 
of strife. And they were extremely warlike. Worse, they were can-
nibalistic, eating the enemy warriors they captured. In fact, the very 
word   cannibal   comes from the Spanish name for the Carib Indians. 
The Spanish arrived in the ifteenth century and, unfortunately, they 
carried diseases to which the Indians had no immunity. Many Indians 
succumbed to common European illnesses; others died from the hard

A metaphor is a poetic device that deals with comparison. It compares 
similar qualities of two dissimilar objects. With a simple metaphor, 
one object becomes the other:   Love is a rose  . Although this does not 
sound like a particularly rich image, a metaphor can communicate 
so much about a particular image that poets use them more than any 
other type of igurative language. The reason for this is that poets 
compose their poetry to express what they are experiencing emotion-
ally at that moment. Consequently, what the poet imagines love to 
be may or may not be our perception of love. Therefore, the poet’s 
job is to enable us to   experience   it, to feel it the same way that the poet 
does. We should be able to nod in agreement and say, “Yes, that’s it! 
I understand precisely where this person is coming from.”
Let’s analyze this remarkably unsophisticated metaphor con-
cerning love and the rose to see what it offers. Because the poet uses 
a comparison with a rose, irst we must examine the characteristics 
of that lower. A rose is spectacular in its beauty, its petals are velvety 
soft, and its aroma is soothing and pleasing. It’s possible to say that 
a rose is actually a veritable feast to the senses: the visual, the tactile, 
and the aural [more commonly known as the senses of sight, touch, 
and sound]. The rose’s appearance seems to border on perfection, 
each petal seemingly symmetrical in form. Isn’t this the way one’s 
love should be? A loved one should be a delight to one’s senses and 
seem perfect. However, there is another dimension added to the 
comparison by using a rose. Roses have thorns. This is the compre-
hensive image the poet wants to communicate; otherwise, a daisy or 
a mum would have been presented to the audience as the ultimate 
representation of love—but the poet didn’t, instead conveying the 
idea that roses can be treacherous. So can love, the metaphor tells 
us. When one reaches out with absolute trust to touch the object of 
his or her affection, ouch, a thorn can cause great harm! “Be care-
ful,” the metaphor admonishes: Love is a feast to the senses, but it

can overwhelm us, and it can also hurt us. It can prick us and cause 
acute suffering. This is the poet’s perception of love—an admonition. 
What is the point? Just this: It took almost 14 sentences to clarify 
what a simple metaphor communicates in only ive words!   That   is the 
artistry and the joy of the simple metaphor.
   196.    The main idea of this passage is

The composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s remarkable musical tal-
ent was apparent even before most children can sing a simple nursery 
rhyme. Wolfgang’s older sister Maria Anna (who the family called 
Nannerl) was learning the clavier, an early keyboard instrument, when   
her three-year-old brother took an interest in playing. As Nannerl 
later recalled, Wolfgang “often spent much time at the clavier picking 
out thirds, which he was always striking, and his pleasure showed that 
it sounded good.” Their father Leopold, an assistant concertmaster at   
the Salzburg Court, recognized his children’s unique gifts and soon 
devoted himself to their musical education.
Born in Salzburg, Austria, on January 27, 1756, Wolfgang had 
composed his irst original work by age ive. Leopold planned to take 
Nannerl and Wolfgang on tour to play before the European courts. 
Their irst venture was to nearby Munich where the children played 
for Maximillian III Joseph, elector of Bavaria. Leopold soon set his 
sights on the capital of the Hapsburg Empire, Vienna. On their way 
to Vienna, the family stopped in Linz, where Wolfgang gave his 
irst public concert. By this time, Wolfgang was not only a virtuoso 
harpsichord player, but he had also mastered the violin. The audi-
ence at Linz was stunned by the six-year-old, and word of his genius 
soon traveled to Vienna. In a much anticipated concert, the Mozart 
children appeared at the Schonbrunn Palace on October 13, 1762. 
They utterly charmed the emperor and empress.
Following this success, Leopold was inundated with invitations 
for the children to play, for a fee. Leopold seized the opportunity and 
booked as many concerts as possible at courts throughout Europe. A 
concert could last three hours, and the children played at least two 
per a day. Today, Leopold might be considered the worst kind of 
stage parent, but at the time, it was not uncommon for prodigies to 
make extensive concert tours. Even so, it was an exhausting schedule 
for a child who was just past the age of needing an afternoon nap.
   201.    A good title for this passage would be
a.    Classical Music in the Eighteenth Century: An Overview.
b.   Stage Parents: A Historical Perspective.
c.    Mozart: The Early Life of a Musical Prodigy.

   178.   d.    The passages states that the Hill sisters’ song was published in 
1924, and the words “happy birthday” were added as a second

   179.   d.    The irst paragraph states that chocolate contains theobromine, 
which cats and dogs cannot process. It also says that theobromine 
is “similar to caffeine,” but   not   that chocolate   contains   caffeine.
   180.   a.     This question requires you to make some inferences. The pas-
sage states that 20 ounces of milk chocolate can kill a 20-pound 
dog; it also states that cats can be harmed by smaller amounts 
than dogs. Therefore, a cat could be poisoned by less than 20 
ounces of milk chocolate.
   181.   d.    The inal paragraph states that dogs like to eat whatever they 
see their owners eating. This is a form of imitation.
   182.   b.    The passage mentions that humans can eat chocolate safely, but 
cats and dogs cannot. Therefore, one might apply choice   to   b
the topic.

soil,” but it says that they grow   best   in slightly acidic soil.
   188.   b.    The passage does not state how daylilies got their name, but it 
does state that the blooms last one day. The reader might infer 
from this that it’s also the reason that they’re called daylilies.
   189.   c.     The last sentence states that they should be planted “no deeper 
than one inch.”
   190.   b.    The word   perennial   means “on-going, occurring indeinitely, 
year after year.” It also refers to lowers that bloom every year 
without needing to be replanted.
   191.   b.    Six thousand years ago   must account for over 2,000 years after 
the birth of Christ, and that leaves almost 4,000 years in the   b.c  . 
era. All other choices are incorrect math.
192.   b.     The Carib were not in any way described as peaceful but rather,

Noniction and Information 
Passages
Fiction is a piece   of writing that tells a story that didn’t really happen 
in real life—it’s   ictional  , made up by the author.   Noniction  , on the other 
hand, refers to a piece of writing about something that   did   happen. History 
books and biographies are noniction because they address actual events 
and real people. Finally,   informational   writing refers to passages whose 
purpose is to inform the reader about something. Informational passages 
contain facts and igures, and include newspaper articles, business memos, 
legal documents, and so on.
In this section, you will be dealing with noniction and information pas-   
sages, such as the type you might ind in a textbook. Mastering these types of 
passages and their questions is important, because they are increasingly being

found in standardized tests. These passages are not necessarily more dificult 
than the ones you’ve already covered in the earlier chapters of this book. 
However, they do call more heavily for the special skill of making inferences, 
of identifying   implicit,   as opposed to   explicit  , ideas stated in the text.
Remember what you’ve learned so far. Look at structure. Look for the 
main idea of the passage. Consider the purpose for which the passage 
was written. What clues can you deduce from the writing style about the 
author’s attitude toward the subject? Is the attitude positive? Negative? 
Objective? Try to pick out individual words that further each writer’s 
intent and support each writer’s opinion. If it helps, underline or make 
notes on important points. Active reading techniques like these will keep 
you focused on some very detailed reading comprehension passages.

The coconut is an unusual food for many reasons. It is technically 
a seed, produced by the coconut palm tree, and as such is one of 
the largest edible seeds produced by any plant. Its unusual contents 
also make it unique in the seed world—the interior consists of both 
“meat” and “water.” The meat is the white pith with which we are all 
familiar, as it is used extensively for cooking and lavorings; the coco-
nut water is a white liquid that is very sweet and thirst-quenching.
Portuguese explorers gave the nut its name in the 15th century, 
referring to it as coco, meaning “ghost” in their language. The three 
dimples and the hairy texture reminded them of a ghost’s face, and 
the tree has retained that name ever since. 
The coconut has many varied uses. It is used to make marga-
rine, as well as various cooking oils, and these cooking oils are used 
by fast-food restaurants around the world to make such diet staples 
as French fries. The coconut luid is a favorite drink in hot climates, 
providing a cool and refreshing beverage right off the tree. This 
water is also used by manufacturers of various sports drinks because 
of its isotonic electrolyte properties. Even the shell itself has many 
uses, including cattle food and fertilizer.
Yet the coconut is also useful in many ways that have nothing 
to do with food. Coconut oil is used for cosmetics, medicines, and 
can even be used in place of diesel fuel. Dried coconut shells are used 
in many countries as a tool, such as a buffer for shining wood loors. 
The shells are also used for shirt buttons, and are commonly found

on Hawaiian clothing. They are even used for musical instruments 
and bird houses!
And all these are only some of the uses found for the coconut 
fruit. The coconut palm tree, which produces the nut, also produces

Saving energy means saving money. Homeowners and renters know 
this basic fact, but they often don’t know what kinds of adjustments they 
can make in their homes and apartments that will result in savings.
For those willing to spend some time and money to reap long-
term energy savings, an energy audit is the way to go. An energy audi-
tor will come into your home and assess its energy eficiency. The 
auditor will pinpoint areas of your home that use the most energy and 
offer solutions to lower your energy use and costs. Trained energy 
auditors know what to look for and can locate a variety of laws that 
may be resulting in energy ineficiency, including inadequate insula-
tion, construction laws, and uneven heat distribution.
There are quicker and less costly measures that can be taken as 
well. One way to save money is to replace incandescent lights with 
luorescents. This can result in a savings of more than 50% on your 
monthly lighting costs.
When it’s time to replace old appliances, it’s wise to spend a bit 
more for an energy-eficient model, and be sure that you are taking 
advantage of energy-saving settings already on your current refrig-
erator, dishwasher, washing machine, or dryer.
Windows provide another opportunity to cut your energy costs. 
Caulk old windows that might be leaky to prevent drafts, and choose 
double-paned windows if you’re building an addition or replacing 
old windows.
Most areas of your home or apartment offer opportunities to 
save energy and money. The results are signiicant and are well worth   
the effort.

Book clubs are a great way to meet new friends or keep in touch 
with old ones, while keeping up on your reading and participating in 
lively and intellectually stimulating discussions. If you’re interested 
in starting a book club, you should consider the following options 
and recommendations.
The irst thing you’ll need are members. Before recruiting, 
think carefully about how many people you want to participate and 
also what the club’s focus will be. For example, some book clubs focus 
exclusively on iction, others read noniction. Some are even more 
speciic, focusing only on a particular genre such as mysteries, science 
iction, or romance. Others have a more lexible and open focus. All 
of these possibilities can make for a great club, but it is important to 
decide on a focus at the outset so the guidelines will be clear to the 
group and prospective member.
After setting the basic parameters, recruitment can begin. Notify 
friends and family, advertise in the local newspaper, and hang lyers 
on bulletin boards in local stores, colleges, libraries, and bookstores. 
When enough people express interest, schedule a kick-off meeting 
during which decisions will be made about speciic guidelines that 
will ensure the club runs smoothly. This meeting will need to estab-
lish where the group will meet (rotating homes or a public venue 
such as a library or coffee shop); how often the group will meet, and 
on what day of the week and at what time; how long the meetings 
will be; how books will be chosen and by whom; who will lead the 
group (if anyone); and whether refreshments will be served and if so, 
who will supply them. By the end of this meeting, these guidelines 
should be set and a book selection and date for the irst oficial meet-
ing should be inalized.
Planning and running a book club is not without challenges, but 
when a book club is run effectively, the experience can be extremely 
rewarding for everyone involved.
   222.    Which of the following organizational patterns is the main one 
used in the passage?
a.    chronological

Last spring, employees of the Hartville Corporation organized a 
weeklong strike to protest poor working conditions and unreasonable 
company policies. The strike resulted in huge inancial losses for the 
company and the threat of a national boycott on Hartville products. 
The situation resulted in the formation of an employee task force, 
supported by Hartville management, to review circumstances that 
led to the strike. The task-force indings follow:
	  n	 	
Hartville’s overtime pay schedule is well below the national 
level, and overtime is mandatory at least once a week. 
	  n	 	
Employees working in the manufacturing department have an 
alarmingly high rate of repetitive stress injury. The equipment 
they are working with is extremely old and dangerous and does 
not meet current health and safety standards. The task force 
recommended that equipment be evaluated and brought up-to-
date immediately.
	  n	 	
Sick and personal day policies are unclear. Employees report 
conlicting and/or confusing policies relating to sick and  
personal days, which have resulted in numerous misunder-
standings about procedures and allowances as well as unfair 
disciplinary action.
	  n	 	
In the past four years, ive pregnant women with clean work 
records were terminated soon after their pregnancies were 
public. In all ive cases, the grounds for iring were not  
speciically cited, although one of the employees was told by 
her immediate supervisor that new mothers make very unreli-
able employees.
	  n	 	
Hartville’s upper management is largely unaware of the 
dissatisfaction of employees. There is evidence that middle 
management withholds vital information leading to upper 
management’s underestimation of the severity of employee 
discontent.

Mental and physical health professionals may consider referring cli-
ents and patients to a music therapist for a number of reasons. It 
seems a particularly good choice for the social worker who is coor-
dinating a client’s case. Music therapists use music to establish a rela-
tionship with the patient and to improve the patient’s health, using 
highly structured musical interactions. Patients and therapists may 
sing, play instruments, dance, compose, or simply listen to music.
The course of training for music therapists is comprehensive. In 
addition to formal musical and therapy training, music therapists are 
taught to discern what kinds of interventions will be most beneicial 
for each individual patient. Because each patient is different and has 
different goals, the music therapist must be able to understand the 
patient’s situation and choose the music and activities that will do the 
most toward helping the patient achieve his or her goals. The refer-
ring social worker can help this process by clearly communicating 
each client’s history.
Although patients may develop their musical skills, that is not 
the main goal of music therapy. Any client who needs particular work 
on communication or on academic, emotional, and social skills, and 
who is not responding to traditional therapy, is an excellent candidate 
for music therapy.
   233.    Which of the following best organizes the main topics addressed in

Light pollution is a growing problem worldwide. Like other forms 
of pollution, light pollution degrades the quality of the environ-

little more than the yellow glare of urban sky-glow. When we lose 
the ability to connect visually with the vastness of the universe by

Emperor Charlemagne of the Franks was crowned in 800   a.d.   The 
Frankish Empire at that time extended over what is now Germany, 
Italy, and France. Charlemagne died in 814   a.d.  , but his brief reign 
marked the dawn of a distinctly European culture. The artists and 
thinkers that helped create this European civilization drew on the 
ancient texts of the Germanic, Celtic, Greek, Roman, Hebrew, and 
Christian worlds. _______________________________________. 
Consequently, they were the groundwork for the laws, customs, and 
even attitudes of today’s Europeans.

would be most consistent with the writer’s purpose and intended 
audience?
a.   Cultural traditions function to identify members of a culture to 
one another and, also, to allow the individual to self-identify.
b.   Many of the traditions of these cultures remained active in 
Frankish society for centuries.
c.   When tradition is lacking or is not honored by the younger 
generation in a society, there is danger that the culture will be 
lost.
d.   It is unnecessary to discuss the origin of these traditions; it will 
only muddy the water.

The ilm   Lawrence of Arabia   may be somewhat dated by modern 
special-effects standards, but it remains a high-water mark in the 
annals of ilmmaking. Since we’re on the subject of CGI and other 
computer-generated special effects, Lawrence has none for the sim-
ple reason that it was actually ilmed using real people who really 
performed the action. The long, slow scenes of camels walking in 
the desert may seem dull to the modern animation-jaded viewer, but 
those willing to pay attention to the underlying themes will be well 
rewarded by what the movie is saying.
And it is the theme of   Lawrence   that really stays with a viewer, 
even today, some 40 years after it was released. That theme is the age-
old story of hubris—the pride of a man which raises him above his 
peers, only to dash him on the rocks of self-indulgence by the end. 
We see this tragic foible of mankind worked out fully in the 
character of Lawrence himself, who begins the ilm as a brilliant genius 
who is eager to get involved in the desert conlicts of World War I. 
His cocky attitude irritates his superiors and amuses the Arabs ighting 
alongside the British, but his genius for details and strategy soon over-
come all obstacles. Lawrence’s brilliant victory at the Suez Canal could 
only have been accomplished by Lawrence, and his own self-sacriice 
and commitment to his followers display the best of his character.
Unfortunately, the baser elements of that character gradually 
take control as the ilm moves along, and Lawrence slowly declines 
into a dangerous blend of despair and self-assurance. The problem

gradually becomes evident: Lawrence has grown to believe that he is 
equal to God, the one who both gives life and takes it away again.

c.    admires the ilm   Lawrence of Arabia  .
d.   knows nothing about the Suez Canal.
In 1899, Czar Nicholas II of Russia invited the nations of the world 
to a conference at The Hague. This conference—and a follow-up 
organized by Theodore Roosevelt in 1907—ushered in a period of 
vigorous growth in international law. This growth was in response to 
several factors, not the least of which was modern warfare’s increas-
ing potential for destruction. The recently concluded Civil War in 
the United States made this potential clear.
During this growth, the subjects of international law were almost 
exclusively restricted to the relationships that countries had with one 
another. Issues of trade and warfare dominated both the disputes and 
the agreements of the period. ___________, the developments of 
this period paved the way for further expansion of international law, 
which has occurred in the last several years. ________, organizations 
such as the United Nations and the International Court of Justice 
are greatly concerned not only with the way countries deal with one 
another, but with the ways in which they treat their own citizens.

A healthy diet with proper nutrition is essential for maintaining good 
overall health. Since the discovery of vitamins earlier in this century, 
people have routinely been taking vitamin supplements for this pur-
pose. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) is a frequently 
used nutritional standard for maintaining optimal health. The RDA 
speciies the recommended amount of a number of nutrients for peo-
ple in different age and sex groups. The National Research Council’s 
Committee on Diet and Health has proposed a deinition of the RDA 
to be that amount of a nutrient which meets the needs of 98% of the 
population.
The RDA approach _________________ . First, it is based on 
the assumption that it is possible to accurately deine nutritional 
requirements for a given group. However, individual nutritional 
requirements can vary widely within each group. The eficiency with 
which a person converts food intake into nutrients can also vary

widely. Certain foods when eaten in combination actually prevent 
the absorption of nutrients. For example, spinach combined with 
milk reduces the amount of calcium available to the body from the 
milk. Also, the RDA approach speciies a different dietary require-
ment for each age and sex; however, it is clearly unrealistic to expect 
a homemaker to prepare a different menu for each family member. 
Still, although we cannot rely solely upon RDA to ensure our overall 
long-term health, it can be a useful guide so long as its limitations 
are recognized.
  253.    Which of the following would best it in the blank in the irst sen-

a.   is based on studies by respected nutritionists
b.   has a number of shortcomings
c.   has been debunked in the last few years
d.   is full of holes

a.   The RDA approach should be replaced by a more realistic 
nutritional guide.
b.   The RDA approach should be supplemented with more speciic 
nutritional guides.
c.   In spite of its laws, the RDA approach is deinitely the best 
guide to good nutrition.
d.   The RDA approach is most suitable for a large family.
Businesses today routinely keep track of large amounts of both inan-
cial and non-inancial information. Sales departments keep track of 
current and potential customers; marketing departments keep track 
of product details and regional demographics; accounting depart-
ments keep track of inancial data and issue reports. To be useful, 
all this data must be organized into a meaningful and useful system. 
Such a system is called a   management information system  , abbreviated 
MIS. The inancial hub of the MIS is accounting.
Accounting is the information system that records, analyzes, 
and reports economic transactions, enabling decision makers to make 
informed choices when allocating scarce economic resources. It is a

tool that enables the user, whether a business entity or an individual, 
to make wiser, more informed economic choices. It is an aid to plan-
ning, controlling, and evaluating a broad range of activities. A inan-
cial accounting system is intended for use by both the management 
of an organization and those outside the organization. Because it is 
important that inancial accounting reports be interpreted correctly, 
inancial accounting is subject to a set of ___________ guidelines 
called “generally accepted accounting principles” (GAAP).

Typically, people think of genius, whether it manifests in Mozart’s 
composition of symphonies at age ive or Einstein’s discovery of 
relativity, as having a quality not just of the supernatural, but also 
of the eccentric. People see genius as a good abnormality; more-
over, they think of genius as a completely unpredictable abnormality. 
Until recently, psychologists regarded the quirks of genius as too 
erratic to describe intelligibly; however, Anna Findley’s ground-
breaking study uncovers predictable patterns in the biographies 
of geniuses. These patterns do not dispel the common belief that 
there is a kind of supernatural intervention in the lives of unusually 
talented men and women, however, even though they occur with 
regularity. __________, Findley shows that all geniuses experience 
three intensely productive periods in their lives, one of which always 
occurs shortly before their deaths; this is true whether the genius 
lives to 19 or 90.

O’Connell Street is the main thoroughfare of Dublin City. Although 
it is not a particularly long street, Dubliners will proudly tell the 
visitor that it is the widest street in all of Europe. This claim usually 
meets with protests, especially from French tourists, claiming the 
Champs Elysees of Paris as Europe’s widest street. But the witty 
Dubliner will not easily relinquish bragging rights and will trump 
the French visitor with a ine distinction: The Champs Elysees is a 
boulevard  ; O’Connell is a   street  .
Divided by several important monuments running the length 
of its center, the street is named for Daniel O’Connell, an Irish 
patriot. _____________________________. O’Connell stands high 
above the unhurried crowds of shoppers, business people, and stu-
dents on a sturdy column, surrounded by four serene angels seated 
at each corner of the monument’s base. Further up the street is the 
famous General Post Ofice that locals affectionately call the GPO. 
During the 1916 rebellion, the GPO was taken over from British 
rule and occupied by Irish rebels, sparking weeks of armed combat 
in the city’s center. To this day, the angels of O’Connell’s monument 
bear the marks of the ighting: One sits reading calmly, apparently 
unaware of the bullet hole dimpling her upper arm; another, reaching 
out to stroke the ears of a huge bronze Irish wolfhound has survived 
what should be a mortal wound to her heart.
  262.    Which sentence, if inserted in the blank space in the passage, 
would be the most correct and contribute the most pertinent infor-

a.   His monument stands at the lower end of the road, that is, the 
end closest to the river Liffey that bisects Dublin.
b.   Other monuments along the street include statues to Charles 
Parnell, Anna Livia Plurabelle, and James Joyce.
c.   Dublin tourist buses leave from this site every 20 minutes.
d.   Daniel O’Connell was an important Irish nationalist, who died 
before the 1916 rebellion.

Excerpt from Chamber of Commerce brochure
Dilly’s Deli provides a dining experience like no other! A rustic 
atmosphere, along with delicious food, provide an opportunity to 
soak up the local lavor. Recently relocated to the old market area, 
Dilly’s is especially popular for lunch. At the counter, you can place 
your order for one of Dilly’s three daily lunch specials or one of 
several sandwiches, all at reasonable prices. Once you get your food, 
choose a seat at one of the four charming communal tables. By the 
time you are ready to carry your paper plate to the trash bin, you have 
experienced some of the best food and one of the most charming 
companies our city has to offer.
Restaurant review
Yesterday, I was exposed to what has been called “a dining experience 
like no other.” At lunchtime, Dilly’s Deli is so crowded, I wondered 
when the ire marshal had last visited the establishment. The line snaked 
out the door to the corner, and by the time I reached the counter, I was 
freezing. I decided on the hamburger steak special; the other specials 
being liver and onions or tuna casserole. Each special is offered with 
two side dishes, but there was no potato salad left and the green beans 
were cooked nearly beyond recognition. I chose the gelatin of the day 
and what turned out to be the blandest coleslaw I have ever eaten.
At Dilly’s, you sit at one of four long tables. The couple sitting 
across from me was having an argument. The truck driver next to me 
told me more than I wanted to know about highway taxes. After I had 
tasted all of the food on my plate, I rose to leave, whereupon one of 
the people working behind the counter yelled at me to clean up after 
myself. Throwing away that plate of food was the most enjoyable 
part of dining at Dilly’s.
  266.    If you go to lunch at Dilly’s Deli, you could expect to see
a.   a long line of customers.
b.   the ire marshal.
c.   the restaurant critic from the newspaper.
d.   homemade pie.

The Hopkinton Town Council met last night to address the ques-
tion of building a skate-board ramp in Wilcox Park, but the public 
response segment of the meeting took much longer than anticipated, 
and the question had to be shelved until next meeting.
Chairman Mark Santucci opened the loor for public comment 
soon after the issue was raised, and for the next two hours the public 
took advantage of the opportunity. An estimated 375 local residents 
turned out for the meeting, and nearly 200 of those present stepped 
to the microphone to voice their views.
Many residents were vehemently opposed to the proposal to 
build a large skate boarding area in the southeast corner of the park. 
The proposed facilities would include a “tunnel,” several ramps, and 
a “dish”—all made of cement for use by skate-boarders.
“The last thing we need in this town,” stated Michael Fritz of 
Hopkinton, “is more grafiti. If we put in a skate board park, that’s 
exactly what we’ll get for our efforts.”
A few of those who spoke, however, endorsed the proposal.
“Our kids need fresh air and exercise,” complained Betty Kelly 
of Hopkinton. “They spend too much time as it is playing video 
games. This would give them someplace to go.”
The next meeting was scheduled for June 15.
  271.    What is the central issue that is causing conlict in Hopkinton,  
according to this passage?
a.   the delay in resolving the skate boarding issue
b.   whether taxpayers should pay for park improvements
c.   the moral implications of skate boarding
d.   whether the town should build a skate board park
  272.    What is the central argument of Betty Kelly’s comments?
a.   Kids need more freedom and less supervision.
b.   Kids need a place to play outdoors.
c.   Parents nowadays are irresponsible.
d.   The town council needs to be more responsive.

During those barren winter months, with windows overlooking long-
dead gardens, lealess trees, and lawns that seem to have an ashy 
look about them, nothing soothes the jangled nerves more than the 
vibrant green of plants surrounding the living spaces of one’s home. 
People browse through garden stores just to get a whiff of chloro-
phyll and to choose a plant or two to bring spring back into their 
winter-gray lives.
Now there is even more of a need for “the green,” in light of 
recent articles warning us of the hazards of chemicals that we, our-
selves, introduce into our homes. Each time we bring clothes home 
from the cleaners, we release those chemicals into the closed-in 
air of our dwellings. Every cleanser releases its own assortment of 
fumes. Some of the chemicals are formaldehyde, chlorine, benzene, 
styrene, etc. Read the labels on many home products, the ingredi-
ents aren’t even listed! During the winter, when those same windows 
are shut tight, we breathe in these chemicals—causing symptoms

much like allergies. In fact, most people probably dismiss the effects 
of these chemicals simply as a lare up of some allergy or other. The 
truth is that we are experiencing a syndrome that is called Mul-
tiple Chemical Sensitivity. Now, what has this got to do with green 
plants? Everything healthy! Research has been conducted with two 
types of plants that have actually removed much of these harmful 
chemicals from the air.
The two plants that seem to be the best bet for ridding one’s 
home of such chemicals are ferns and palms. These plants release 
moisture as part of photosynthesis and, as they do, pull chemicals 
from the air into their leaves. Even NASA has conducted some green-
house experiments for long-term space exploration. Within hours, 
their plants [palms] had removed almost all traces of formaldehyde in 
the room. Both species of plants are ancient, dating back more than a 
hundred million years. Another trait they share is that they both live 
long lives, 100 years or more. This we expect from trees, but ferns 
and palms are plants; plants that can grow to 65 feet in the proper 
setting! Even their individual leaves live for one to two years [ferns] 
and one to nine years [palms]. Perhaps it is their primal qualities that 
have contributed to their ability to purify their environment.

a.   Our homes are full of contaminants.
b.   Our allergies are caused by chemicals found in the home.
c.   All plants release moisture in the home.

Despite their similarities, the pyramids of Egypt and Mesoamerica

cut stone quarried many miles away from the pyramid sites—a con-
struction method that enabled them to construct sturdy buildings 
that could withstand the test of time.
On the other hand, the pyramids of Mesoamerica were not built 
to withstand the ravages of time. Rather, the step pyramids rose in 
tiers, on the top of which a small temple was erected. Unlike the 
Egyptians, they used irregular stones.
Also, they did not share the same basic design function. The 
Egyptian pyramids were private tombs meant to separate the pha-
raoh’s remains from the mainstream of society and protect him for 
eternity, while the pyramids of Mesoamerica were primarily public 
temples of ritual and celebration.

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
Answers
   210.   d.    The word   pith   means meat or core, and it refers here to the ed-
ible part of the coconut.
   211.   b.    The passage states that Portuguese explorers thought the coco-
nut resembled a face, because of its three dimples (like eyes and 
mouth) and its hairy texture.
   212.   b.    The passage does touch briely on most of these choices, but the 
main focus is on the many ways that coconut palms are used.
   213.   a.     The passage details the many valuable uses for the coconut 
palm, so choice a is best. None of the other choices is implied.
   214.   c.     All of the choices are included in the passage except helium bal-
loons, which are not mentioned.
   215.   d.    The word   staples   in this context refers to commonly used items. 
The best choice for “diet staples” is   foods  .
   216.   b.    The inal paragraph implies that the tree’s many uses and foods 
earned it the name “tree of life.” None of the other choices is 
supported by the passage.
  217.   b.    Ideas are listed by topic, but there is some cause and effect as 
well since the passage explains the reasons for the various steps. 
The other choices are incorrect because the passage does not 
list the ideas in order of importance (hierarchical) or in the 
order in which they have occurred or should occur (chronologi-
cal). These steps can occur in any order.
  218.   c.     The passage does say that a homeowner can have an energy 
audit, but it says nothing about a local energy company pro-
viding that service. Choice   may seem attractive at irst since   a
those speciic igures are not mentioned in the passage, but the 
third paragraph does say that luorescent bulbs can save 50% on 
lighting costs, and $65 is almost 50% less than $135. Choices   b 
and   are clearly stated in the passage.  d
  219.   a.     The passage is offering recommendations about the many 
things homeowners and renters can do to save money and 
energy. The other choices may all be mentioned in the passage, 
but they are too speciic to be the main idea.

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
  220.   d.    The passage says nothing about an energy auditor actually ix-
ing the laws him- or herself, simply that the auditor will locate 
the laws and offer possible money-saving solutions.
  221.   a.     The ifth paragraph states that double-paned windows can 
cut energy costs, so we can infer that this means that they are 
energy eficient. The other three choices are not stated in the 
passage.
   222.   a.     The passage is organized chronologically. The steps for starting 
a book club are listed in the order in which they should occur.
  223.   c.   The second sentence of the second paragraph states this clearly.
  224.   d.    Deciding on the club’s focus—the kinds of books or genre the 
club will read—should be done prior to this meeting and prior 
to recruiting members, according to the second paragraph.
  225.   b.    This is the only appropriate title. Choice   is too speciic, since   a
the passage indicates that making new friends is just one com-
ponent of a book club. Choice   is incorrect because this pas-  c
sage does not contain numbered steps. Choice   is too vague,   d
and the tone is inappropriate.
  226.   a.     The passage states this is one possible focus but does not say 
successful book clubs must focus exclusively on one genre. The 
other choices are all in the passage. Choice   might seem attrac-  c
tive at irst, but the passage clearly states that a focus should be 
chosen, even if that focus is deined as lexible and open.
  227.   d.    The tone and speciicity of the passage infer that a successful 
book club requires careful planning.
  228.   d.    This is a listing of reasons why Hartville employees are unhappy 
and went on strike.
  229.   c.     The second sentence of the second task-force inding states that 
Hartville’s equipment does not meet current health and safety 
standards. Choices   and   may be attractive at irst, but choice   a  b
a   is incorrect because it doesn’t say the equipment is broken, 
just that it is old and dangerous. Choice   is incorrect because   b
computer keyboards are not mentioned, and there is no indica-
tion that computer keyboards are included in the equipment 
being discussed.

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
  230.   d.    The only speciic recommendation in the task-force ind-
ings appears in the second inding regarding equipment in the 
manufacturing department, in the inal sentence.
  231.   b.    The inal inding of the task force states that due to the with-
holding of information by middle management, upper manage-
ment is unaware of the severity of employee discontent. The 
other choices are not stated in the passage.
  232.   d.    The third task-force inding states that sick and personal day poli-
cies are unclear, and no outline of an actual policy is provided. 
   233.   c.     Choice c provides the best outline of the passage. The other 
choices all contain points that are not covered by the passage.
   234.   b.    This passage provides information to social workers about music 
therapy, as the title in choice   indicates. Choice   is incorrect   b  d
because the irst sentence speaks of mental- and physical-health 
professionals   referring   their clients and patients to music thera-
pists; the second sentence indicates that   (meaning a   it  referral  ) 
seems a particularly good choice for the social worker  . Choice   is   c
possible, but does not summarize the passage as well as choice  .   b
Choice   refers to a topic not covered in the passage.  a
   235.   d.    Although the other choices may be correct, they require 
knowledge beyond the passage. Based on the information in 
the passage,   is the best choice.  d
   236.   a.     Based particularly on the last sentence of the passage,   is the best   a
choice. The other choices are beyond the scope of the passage.
   237.   d.    In the Northern Hemisphere, June 21 would be summer; how-
ever, according to the passage, it is the beginning of winter in 
the Southern Hemisphere.
   238.   b.    Logically, if June 21 is called the summer solstice in the North-
ern Hemisphere, then that same day would be the winter solstice 
in the Southern Hemisphere.
   239.   d.    A careful reading of the passage is required for this question, be-
cause the author does not provide a step-by-step, numbered list 
of instructions. Yet he   does   give clear instructions on how to paint 
wood, and the reader must create a step-by-step list in his or her 
own mind. Choice   includes all the steps in the correct order.  d
   240.   d.   See the inal sentence of the passage.

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
   241.   d.    Choice   is the most accurate conclusion because the irst sen-  d
tence speaks of   periods of war  . The other choices, whether true 
or false, are not addressed in the selection.
   242.   d.    Although the people in the other choices might read this pas-
sage, it is not directed toward scholars (choices   and  ), nor   a  b
is there anything in it about operating a loom (choice  ). The   c
light, informative tone, as well as the subject matter of the 
inal sentence, particularly indicate that the passage is directed 
toward interior decorators.
243.   a.     Choices  and   are beyond the scope of this passage and a    c  d
reader would not be able to tell if the author believed them, 
based on the information provided. Choice   relects a point of   c
view that would be unlikely for the author based on the con-
tent of this passage, which implies that the author believes that 
women and men have an equal need for education.
   244.   b.    The missing sentence is in a portion of the passage that dis-
cusses the long-term impacts of the Franks; therefore,   is the   b
best choice. Choices   and   are written in a style appropriate to   a  c
the passage, but the information is not appropriate. Choice   is   d
more informal in style than the rest of the passage.
   245.   b.    Although all of the choices are possible deinitions of   culture  , 
the passage is speaking of a community of interrelated individu-
als, namely, Europeans.
   246.   a.     The passage explicitly states that Charlemagne was crowned 
emperor in 800 and died in 814—a period of 14 years. There-
fore, choices  , , and   are mathematically incorrect.  b  c  d
247.   b.    Man’s pride will bring about his destruction. The author speaks 
about the pride of Lawrence, explaining how the ilm shows 
Lawrence’s rise and fall.
248.   d.    The author deines it indirectly in the article by saying that 
hubris is “the pride of a man.”
249.   c.     The author’s tone is very enthusiastic about the movie, and  
he even refers to it as “a high-water mark in the annals of  
ilmmaking.”

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
   250.   b.    The context of the passage indicates that the sentences in ques-
tion are pointing out an unforeseen consequence (  however  ) and 
the current situation (  now  ). The other choices would result in 
meanings that do not it with the low of information in the rest 
of the passage.
   251.   d.    Choices  , , and   are not supported by information in the pas-  a  b  c
sage. Thus, the best choice is  .  d
   252.   d.    Choices   and   are possible deinitions of   a  c  ushered,   but do not 
it in the context of the passage. Choice   is an incorrect deini-  b
tion.   Heralded  , choice  , is the best deinition in the context.  d
   253.   b.    The blank is followed by a discussion of the shortcomings of 
the RDA approach. Choice   is incorrect because it does not   a
lead into a discussion regarding the RDA approach’s shortcom-
ings. Choice   is incorrect because it is contradicted by the inal   c
sentence of the passage, which states that the RDA approach 
remains a   useful guide  . Choice   is incorrect because its casual   d
style is inconsistent with the style used in the rest of the passage.
   254.   b.    Choice   is indicated by the inal sentence, which indicates that   b
the RDA approach is useful, but has limitations, implying that a 
supplemental guide would be a good thing. Choice   is contra-  a
dicted by the inal sentence of the passage. Choice   is incorrect   c
because the passage says the RDA approach is a   useful guide  , but 
does not say it is the best guide to good nutrition. Choice   is   d
contradicted by the next to last sentence of the passage.
   255.   b.    The passage contains objective information about accounting 
such as one might ind in a textbook. There is nothing new or 
newsworthy in it (choice  ). The passage does not contain the   a
signiicant amount of personal opinion one might ind in an 
essay (choice  ). It does not deal with matters that might involve   c
government (choice  ).  d
   256.   d.    The inal sentence emphasizes the importance of correct inter-
pretation of inancial accounting. Choice   is wrong, because   a
something so important would not be discretionary (optional). 
Choice   may be true, but it is not as important for guidelines   b
to be convenient as it is for them to be rigorous. Choice   is   c
wrong because the word   austere   connotes sternness. People may 
be stern, but inanimate entities, such as guidelines, cannot be.

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
   257.   b.    Choices  , , and   are all listed in the passage as functions of   a  c  d
accounting. On the other hand, the second sentence of the  
passage speaks of a   marketing department  , separate from the  
accounting department  .
   258.   a.     The inal sentence is an instance of a regular pattern that still 
has an uncanny quality. Choices   and   would introduce a    b  c
sentence with an idea contradicting the preceding. Choice     d
would indicate that the inal sentence is a restatement of the 
preceding, which it is not.
   259.   d.    The passage says that people in general consider genius   super-
natural, but also . . . eccentric  ; the pairing of   extraordinary   and 
erratic   in choice   includes both meanings given in the passage.   d
Choices   and   cover only one side of the passage’s meaning.   a  c
Choice   contains deinitions that the passage does not ascribe   b
to the common view of genius.
   260.   c.     This title covers the main point of the passage that, although 
there are predictable patterns in the lives of geniuses, the  
pattern increases the sense of something supernatural touching 
their lives. Choices   and   are too general. Choice   is inaccu-  a  b  d
rate because the passage does not talk about disorder in the life 
of a genius.
   261.   c.   All the other statements are inaccurate.
   262.   a.     This choice sticks to the subject, Daniel O’Connell. It provides 
a transition to the sentence following it by giving information 
about the location of the statue. Choices   and   swerve off   b  c
topic, and choice   essentially repeats information given else-  d
where in the paragraph.
   263.   d.    The title   Sights and History on Dublin’s O’Connell Street   touches 
on all the speciic subjects of the passage: the sights to see on this 
particular street and the history connected to them. Choice   is   a
too general about the place described, which is a particular street 
in Dublin, not the whole city. Choices   and   are too speciic in   b  c
that they cover only the material in the irst paragraph.
   264.   c.     The hidden or key resource mentioned in the passage is the ine 
distinction between the deinition of   street   and   boulevard  , which is 
used to win the argument with or   get the better of   tourists. Choices 
a   and   do not make sense; answer   is incorrect because there is   b  d
no real fraud used in the argument in the passage.

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
   265.   d.    The author offers an example of Dublin wit and mentions  
the   unhurried   pace of Dublin crowds. Choice   interprets the   a
adjective   unhurried   in too negative a manner for the tone of the 
passage. Choices   and   similarly interpret the playful joke on   b  c
French tourists too disparagingly.
   266.   a.     This is implied in the irst passage, which says that Dilly’s is 
“popular,” and the same idea is explicitly stated in the second  
passage.
   267.   d.     This is the only one of the choices that is implied in both passages.
   268.   d.    This is the only quotation from the second passage that reveals 
the critic’s opinion of the quality of the food.
   269.   a.     The fact that the overall tone of the passage is quite negative 
indicates the writer’s purpose.
   270.   c.     In contrast to the second passage, the irst passage seems to be 
encouraging a visit to Dilly’s. Choices  ,  , and  are not men-  a b     d
tioned in the passage.
   271.   d.    The issue which is causing conlict is the question of whether or 
not to build a skate board park. Several residents were quoted 
who had very different opinions, but none of the other choices 
was addressed.
   272.   b.    Betty Kelly is quoted, addressing her concerns that kids in town 
have no place to go, so they stay home and play video games. 
She might or might not agree with the other choices, but we are 
not told her opinions in this passage.
   273.   d.    The word   vehemence   means passion or strong feeling. The pas-
sage tells us that the public spoke out passionately on the subject.
   274.   d.   This is stated in the irst paragraph.
   275.   d.    This answer is broad enough to support all the information 
discussed in the passage: chemicals in the home, research on 
certain houseplants, the suggestion of the best plants for the job 
and why. Choice   only deals with contaminants. Choice   sug-  a  b
gests our allergies are caused by chemicals in the home, when 
the passage suggests that we unknowingly blame our symptoms 
on allergies. Choice   suggests that the passage is only about   c
plants in the home.

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
   276.   c.     This is explicitly stated in the passage. Choice   is an incor-  a
rect assumption, as the passage does not discuss allergies; it 
states that we dismiss the symptoms, blaming allergies as the 
cause. Choice   is tempting, but it is not a speciic effect of the   b
chemicals combining; it merely states that ridding our homes of 
impurities seems a great task. Choice   is incorrect because the   d
combination of harmful chemicals does not trigger the process 
of photosynthesis in any way.
   277.   a.     It is clearly stated that research has been done using   certain   
houseplants. Choice   is incorrect because the sentence that   b
deals with NASA suggests that   even   NASA is conducting experi-
ments. Choice   reveals a faulty reading of the passage in which   c
three of the chemicals are clearly named. Choice   is incorrect   d
because the main idea of the passage is for the beneit of  
homeowners.
   278.   b.    This answer is inferred in the last line of the passage:   primal 
qualities . . . ability to purify their environment.   Choices   and     a  c
are incorrect because   antiquity   refers to how long the species 
has been on the planet, which has no relationship to how long a 
life span the individual plants or leaves have. Choice   is incor-  d
rect. One cannot make a general statement on how successful 
the plants’ reactions are in research experiments when the pas-
sage only presents us with one type of research experiment.
   279.   c.     This title focuses on the main idea of the passage: purifying 
one’s home of chemical impurities by using common house-
plants. Choice   is incorrect because only one experiment is   a
discussed, and no mention of the millennium is made at all. 
Choice   is also incorrect because the passage only discusses   b
one problem: impurities caused by chemicals, which is not even 
labeled as a danger. Choice   is supported by two sentences in   d
the passage, but it is not broad enough to support all the infor-
mation offered in the passage.
   280.   c.   The passage best relects this choice.
   281.   a.   The passage supports this choice only.
   282.   d.   According to the passage, this is the only correct choice.
   283.   c.   The purpose of Egyptian pyramids was to house the dead forever.

   284.   c.     The passage opens with the clear statement that employees 
should always dress professionally. The other answers might 
be implied in the passage, but the main idea is that appearance 
matters in the ofice.
   285.   d.   A mandate is a command, and is the root of the word   mandatory  .
   286.   d.    T-shirts are not directly addressed in the memo, but similar 
clothing is addressed—such as blue jeans and shorts. One can 
safely infer, therefore, that T-shirts are unacceptable if shorts 
are unacceptable.
   287.   a.     There is no anger or confrontation in the writer’s tone—but 
there is no humor, either. The document is simply informing 
employees of the rules.

Reading Charts and Graphs, 
Understanding Directions
This is a section   with questions that can be applied to situations that 
you ind in everyday life. On the job, in your school, at the train station, 
in the grocery store, or in many other ordinary situations, you might ind 
yourself trying to get information from a graph, chart, or table. You may 
even ind situations where you have to listen to and act upon written or 
verbal directions.
Unlike other sections in this book, the questions that you answer in this 
section are based on concrete information, rather than hidden or implied 
material within the text. So the most important thing is to pay attention to 
every detail. Read every set of directions as many times as necessary. Also, 
read the title and footnotes carefully.
The ability to completely understand directions, graphs, charts, and 
tables is vital in today’s information age, but as you may know, it is not 
analYZe
Use explicit information to infer your own conclusions. This is 
often done by comparing and contrasting two or more pieces of 
information.

mechanical repair, the driver should ill out the pink repair requisi-
tion form and give it to the shift supervisor. The driver should also 
notify the shift supervisor verbally whether, in the driver’s opinion, 
the vehicle must be repaired immediately or may be driven until the 
end of the shift.

Beginning next month, the city will institute a program intended to 
remove grafiti from city-owned delivery trucks. Any truck that in-
ishes its assigned route before the end of the driver’s shift will return 
to its lot where supervisors will provide materials for that driver to 
use while cleaning the truck. Because the length of time it takes to 
complete different tasks and routes vary, trucks within the same 
department will no longer be assigned to speciic routes but will be 
rotated among the routes. Therefore, drivers should no longer leave 
personal items in the trucks, because they will not necessarily be driv-
ing the same truck each day, as they did in the past.

During the next ten months, all bus operators with two or more years 
of service will be required to have completed 20 hours of refresher 
training on one of the Vehicle Maneuvering Training Buses.

Analyzing and 
Interpreting Poems
Poetry  scares  some  people,   mainly  because  they  believe  that 
poems have hidden meanings. A good way to approach poetry is by reading 
closely for the literal meaning. In reality, poetry compresses the language 
into small sentences or phrases, so it just seems that the meanings are hid-
den. Ask yourself, what is that poet’s view on the subject? If you add a few 
of your own thoughts and experiences, you can uncover what has been 
left out. Think of it as frozen orange juice. Add water and you have the 
entire amount. Also, remember that poets compare objects to other objects 
. . . just like the frozen orange-juice metaphor. Think back to Chapter 2, 
Analogies, and remember the way you made comparisons there.

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
As you begin to read the poems in this section, it is important to under-
stand who is speaking in the poem. (The speaker may not be the poet.) 
Once you can identify the narrator, you should be able to get an idea of 
the narrator’s attitude toward the subject, and this is easily discovered by 
the author’s word choice. Through the images that the words make, you 
should be able to answer the questions correctly.

Most Traditional poetry follows a rhythmic pattern and rhyme 
scheme. Note how these two lines rhyme and share the same 
rhyme and share the same rhythm or meter:

A narrow Fellow in the grass
Occasionally rides—
You may have met him—did you not

A spotted shaft is seen—
And then it closes at your feet
And opens further on—
He likes a Boggy Acre—
A Floor too cool for Corn—
Yet when a Boy, and Barefoot—
I more than once at Noon
Have passed, I thought, a Whip-lash
Unbraiding in the Sun—
When, stooping to secure it,
It wrinkled, and was gone—
Several of Nature’s People
I know, and they know me—
I feel for them a transport
Of cordiality—
But never met this Fellow,
Attended, or alone—
Without a tighter breathing
And zero at the bone—

Poetry often uses words in unexpected ways. This forces the reader to con-
sider the deeper meanings of words, while also relecting on the idea that 
the poet hopes to get across. Consider both the words and the ideas in this 
poem by Sir Walter Scott.
Patriotism
Breathes there the man with soul so dead,
Who never to himself hath said,
   “This is my own, my native land!”
Whose heart hath ne’er within him burned
As home his footsteps he hath turned
   From wandering on a foreign strand?
If such there breathe, go, mark him well;
For him no Minstrel raptures swell;
High though his titles, proud his name,
Boundless his wealth as wish can claim;
Despite those titles, power, and pelf,
The wretch, concentred all in self,
Living, shall forfeit fair renown,
And, doubly dying, shall go down
To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonored, and unsung. 
  339.    What is the most likely meaning of the underlined word   pelf  , as 
used in this poem?
a.   power
b.   wealth
c.   stealth
d.   health
  340.    What is the poet’s main idea in this poem?
a.   Those who become rich must hate their country.
b.   Traveling abroad helps a person appreciate home.
c.   Those who do not love their country will not be honored.
d.   Patriotism is the last refuge for scoundrels.

This next poem is by William Shakespeare.
The Seven ages of man
All the world’s a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances;
And one man in his time plays many parts.
His acts being seven ages. At irst the infant,
Mewling . . . in the nurse’s arms.
And then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
And shining morning face . . . And then the lover,
Sighing like a furnace . . . Then a soldier
Full of strange oaths . . . Jealous of honor,
Sudden and quick in quarrel . . . And then the  
     justice . . . 
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon.
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side.
 . . . and his big manly voice, Turning again toward
Childish treble, pipes and whistles in his sound.
Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness, and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.
  344.    What attitude does the speaker reveal by using the word   merely   in 
the second line?
a.   sorrow
b.   anger
c.   amusement
d.   indifference
  345.    What characterizes the period of life represented by the soldier?
a.   brash behavior
b.   his sense of honor
c.   his dedication to duty
d.   his fear of cowardice

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
Answers
   329.   b.    The eagle, who   watches from his mountain walls   and falls   like a 
thunderbolt  , is depicted as too alert and dynamic to be dying 
(choice  ). There is really no joy depicted in the poem nor any   a
sense that this is a baby eagle (choice  ), and there is no men-  c
tion of baby birds the eagle might be watching over (choice  ).   d
Saying that the eagle   watches   and then falls   like a thunderbolt   im-
plies alertness and then striking, respectively. The most logical 
choice is that the eagle is hunting.
   330.   b.    The word   azure   means   blue   and is often used to describe the 
sky. Neither a forest nor cliffs are azure (choices   and  ), and   a  c
nature is not mentioned as an entity in the poem (choice  ).  d
   331.   a.     It is the   wrinkled sea   that   crawls   in the irst line of the second 
stanza of the poem.
   332.   b.    The   fellow   frightens the speaker—  a, c,   and   are not frightening.  d
   333.   a.     Tighter breathing   indicates fear, as does   zero at the bone   (one is 
sometimes said to be cold with fear). Also, the subject is a snake, 
which is generally a feared animal.
   334.   c.     In context, the speaker is discussing animals, because he follows 
with his contrasting attitude toward   this fellow  , meaning the 
snake. The other choices are all human beings.
   335.   b.    Stanza 3 contains the phrase   when a boy   implying the speaker 
was a boy in the past and is now, therefore, an adult man.
   336.   b.    The poem describes nature in terms of the murder of a happy 
lower, and includes the words   beheads   and   assassin  ; therefore, 
the most logical description of the poet’s attitude would not be 
delight, indifference,   or   reverence,   but rather   dismay  .
   337.   c.     The lower in the poem is   happy   and feels   no surprise   that it must 
die, which implies   acceptance  . If there is any hint of   fear   or   hor-
ror   in the poem (choices   and  ), it is on the part of the poet.   a  b
Nothing in the poem is described as feeling   reverence   (choice  ).  d

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
   338.   c.     A God who would approve of a happy lower being beheaded, 
while, apparently, the rest of the natural world (as exempliied 
by the sun) remains unmoved, is probably not to be regarded as 
benevolent or just (choices   and  ). Approval does not connote   a  b
anger (choice  ). The most logical choice is that, in this poem,   d
God is cruel (choice  ).  c
   339.   b.    The word   pelf   is an old fashioned term meaning wealth. The 
context of the poem does not support any of the other choices.
   340.   c.     The poem’s title lets the reader know right away that the poem 
is about patriotism. The poet focuses particularly on the person 
who is   not   patriotic, however, suggesting that the one who hates 
his own country will die without honor.
   341.   b.    The phrase “doubly dying” causes the reader to stop and think 
about what the poet is trying to suggest. Scott is saying that the 
unpatriotic person will die physically, just as the patriot will die 
physically—but the unpatriotic person will also experience a sort 
of “second death” when he is completely forgotten in the future. 
The patriot, by contrast, is remembered by future generations.
   342.   c.     The context of the poem is speaking of a person who cares 
only about himself, caring nothing for his country. Therefore, 
concentred   most nearly means “focused on or concerned with” 
himself.
   343.   a.     Sir Walter Scott draws a bleak picture of the person who hates 
his country. It is safe to assume, therefore, that he loved his 
homeland.
   344.   d.    The poet uses   merely   to simply make a statement with no emo-
tion attached to it. Therefore, the other answers are all incor-
rect as anger, amusement, and sorrow are emotions.
   345.   a.     The soldier’s behavior is   aggressive  : cursing, jealous of others 
who receive honor, quick to ight. The lines do not reveal a 
sense of honor, but rather the soldier’s dishonorable behavior. 
There is no mention of dedication, nor anything to suggest a 
fear of cowardice.

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
   346.   c.     The poem begins by stating the “world is a stage” and that we 
are “merely players.” There is no emotion attached to the exits 
and entrances of man in the poet’s tone, thus there is no need 
for anguish or sorrow. Choice   is eliminated by the descrip-  a
tions of the lover and the justice; there is no misery attached to 
them. Choice   discusses a metaphor of life as a journey down a   b
river, and choice   states that life is a comedy. Neither of these   d
choices can be supported by the passage.
   347.   b.    This is supported by the   Last scene of all   in which Shakespeare 
suggests that old age is a second childhood that will lead to 
oblivion without control of the senses, like the infant in the irst 
act. Man has come full circle back to his beginning. No fear of 
death is mentioned, nor is free will, so choices   and   are in-  a  d
correct. Choice   is incorrect because man is used as the subject   c
of the entries, but never presented as a gender-speciic measure.
   348.   d.    The poet accomplishes all three. It softens the effect of both 
suggestions that we are only actors on the world’s stage, and 
that the seventh age of man results in oblivion. It ties his theme 
together by carrying us from the irst stage to the last and then 
back again, and the words convey his tone of indifference, as  
discussed above.

The answers to this section begin on page 169.
The ictional world of Nobel Prize winner Toni Morrison’s novel 
Sula  —the African-American section of Medallion, Ohio, a commu-
nity called the Bottom—is a place where people and natural things 
are apt to go awry, to break from their prescribed boundaries, a place 
where bizarre and unnatural happenings and strange reversals of the 
ordinary are commonplace. The very naming of the setting of   Sula   is 
a turning upside-down of the expected; the Bottom is located high in 
the hills. The novel is illed with images of mutilation, both psycho-
logical and physical. A great part of the lives of the characters, there-
fore, is taken up with making sense of the world, setting boundaries, 
and devising methods to control what is essentially uncontrollable.

The English language premiere of Samuel Beckett’s play   Waiting for 
Godot   took place in London in August 1955.   Godot   is an avant-garde 
play with only ive characters (not including Mr. Godot, who never 
arrives) and a minimal setting: one rock and one bare tree. The play 
has two acts; the second act repeats what little action occurs in the 
irst with few changes: The tree, for instance, acquires one leaf. In a 
statement that was to become famous, the critic, Vivian Mercer, has 
described   Godot   as “a play in which nothing happens twice.” Open-
ing night, critics and playgoers greeted the play with baflement 
and derision. The line, “Nothing happens, nobody comes, nobody 
goes. It’s awful,” was met by a loud rejoinder of “Hear! Hear!” from 
an audience member. ____________________________________.

recognize the play for what history has proven it to be, a revolution-
ary moment in theater.
  351.    Which sentence, if inserted in the blank space on the previous

b.   Despite the audience reaction, the cast and director believed in 
the play.
c.   It looked as if   Waiting for Godot   was beginning a long run as the 
most controversial play of London’s 1955 season.
d.   Waiting for Godot   was in danger of closing the irst week of 
its run and of becoming nothing more than a footnote in the 
annals of the English stage.

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
Plato, the famous Greek philosopher, taught that the things of the 
world around us are merely copies or “shadows” of greater, eternal 
realities. He used a metaphor of people living inside a cave to convey 
his ideas. The people inside the cave could not see the world outside 
the cave, they could only see shadows of people and animals as they 
passed by.
Plato was suggesting that the shadows would seem very real 
and alive to the people inside the cave, because that was all they had 
ever seen of the outside world. But these shadows were not the real, 
living creatures of the outside world, they were merely relections of 
them. Plato’s point was that this temporal world is a ______________ 
of some greater, eternal reality.
  355.    The word that would most accurately it the blank at the end of

This is an excerpt from Mark Twain’s   Roughing It  . Twain gives an eye-
witness account of the operation of the Pony Express, the West’s irst mail 
system.
The little lat mail-pockets strapped under the rider’s thighs would 
each hold about the bulk of a child’s primer. They held many an 
important business chapter and newspaper letter, but these were 
written on paper as airy and thin as gold-leaf, nearly, and thus bulk 
and weight were economized. The stagecoach traveled about a hun-
dred to a hundred and twenty-ive miles a day (twenty-four hours), 
the pony-rider about two hundred and ifty. There were about eighty 
pony-riders in the saddle all the time, night and day, stretching in 
a long, scattering procession from Missouri to California, 40 lying 
eastward, and 40 toward the west, and among them making 400 gal-
lant horses earn a stirring livelihood and see a deal of scenery every 
single day in the year.
We had a consuming desire, from the beginning, to see a pony-
rider, but somehow or other all that passed us and all that met us 
managed to streak by in the night, and so we heard only a whiz and 
a hail, and the swift phantom of the desert was gone before we could 
get our heads out of the windows. But now we were expecting one 
along every moment, and would see him in broad daylight. Presently 
the driver exclaims:
“HERE HE COMES!”
Every neck is stretched further, and every eye strained wider. 
Away across the endless dead level of the prairie a black speck appears 
against the sky, and it is plain that it moves. Well, I should think so! 
In a second or two it becomes a horse and rider, rising and falling, 
rising and falling, rising and falling—sweeping toward us nearer and 
nearer—growing more and more distinct, more and more sharply 
deined—nearer and still nearer, and the lutter of the hoofs comes 
faintly to the ear—another instant a whoop and a hurrah from our 
upper deck, a wave of the rider’s hand, but no reply, and a man and a 
horse burst past our excited faces, and go swinging away like a belated 
fragment of a storm!

Answers
   349.   a.     A   scapegoat   is one who is forced to bear the blame for others or 
upon which the sins of a community are heaped. Choices   and   b
c   are wrong because nowhere in the passage is it implied that 
Sula is a hero or leader, or even that the Bottom has such a per-
sonage. Sula may be a   victim   (choice  ), but a community does   d
not necessarily project evil onto a victim or an outcast the way 
they do onto a scapegoat, so choice   is still the best answer.  a
   350.   d.    The passage says that people who live in the Bottom are   apt to 
go awry, to break from their prescribed boundaries  . A person who is 
eccentric is quirky or odd. Nowhere in the passage is it implied 
that the people are furtive, suspicious, or unkempt (choices  , ,   a  b
and  ).  c
   351.   d.    It is logical that a play would close after such a bad irst-night 
reception, and the sentence in choice   also uses a metaphor   d
about stage history, which is extended in the next sentence. 
Choices  , , and   do not it the sense or syntax of the paragraph,   a  b  c
because the   however   in the next sentence contradicts them.
   352.   d.    The irst line of the passage describes the   English language pre-
miere   of the play, indi-cating it had previous performances in a 
different language.
   353.   a.     Although the other choices are sometimes connotations of the 
term   avant-garde  , the author’s meaning of   innovative   is supported 
by the inal judgment of the passage on the play as revolutionary.
   354.   d.    Although the writer seems amused by the negative criticisms of 
the play, she does give the opinion that it was revolutionary (a 
word that literally means “a turning point”). Choice   under-  a
plays and choice   overestimates the importance of the work to   b
the author of the passage. Choice   is contradicted by the last   c
sentence of the passage.
   355.   a.     Plato’s philosophy taught that the world is a picture or “shad-
ow” of eternity. The other choices would mean the opposite of 
what the passage is saying.
   356.   d.    The word   convey   literally means to move or carry. Plato’s meta-
phor was intended to “carry” an idea to the reader, so “explain” 
is the best choice.

   357.   a.     Plato’s point was that there is another eternal reality apart from 
the world as we know it. Real objects do cast shadows, but that 
is not the main point of the passage, so choice   is not the best   d
answer. Choices   and   are not supported by the passage.  b  c
   358.   b.    The author of the passage is merely explaining Plato’s phi-
losophy. He is not trying to convince the reader that Plato was 
either right or wrong, and he is not attempting to amuse or 
entertain.
   359.   c.     The passage is describing Plato’s cave analogy, so choice   is the   c
most descriptive title.
   360.   d.    The word   temporal   means temporary, something that does not 
last forever.
   361.   d.    The tone of the passage is one of anticipation and excitement.
   362.   b.   A stagecoach rider is narrating the story.
   363.   a.     All the statements can be supported in the passage except this 
choice.
   364.   c.   The passage relects all of the choices except this one.

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
The walnut tree produces wood that is used for countless purposes, 
and is considered the inest wood in the world. The wood is easy to 
work with, yet it is very hard and durable—and when it is polished, 
it produces a rich, dark luster. It also shrinks and swells less than any 
other wood, which makes it especially desirable for ine furniture, 
looring, and even gun stocks.
In fact, just about every part of the walnut is unusually hard and 
strong. The nut of the tree is encased inside a very hard shell, which itself 
is enclosed in a leathery outer covering called a husk. It requires real 
effort to break through those layers to get at the tasty meat inside.
Yet every part of the walnut is useful to people. The outer husk 
produces a dark reddish stain that is hard to remove from the hands 
of the person who opens the nut, and this pigment is widely used in 
dyes and wood stains. The inner shell is used as an abrasive to clean 
jet engines. And the meat of the nut is extensively used in cooking, 
ice cream, lavorings—and just eaten raw.
Walnut trees exude a chemical into the soil near their roots 
which can be poisonous to some trees and shrubs. Fruit trees, for 
example, will not survive if planted too close to a walnut. Many other 
plants, such as maple trees or ivy, are not affected by the walnut’s 
presence, and are well-suited to grow in its vicinity.
  365.    What is the topic of this passage?
a.   the use of walnut wood in furniture
b.   walnut trees
c.   where to plant walnuts
d.   trees of North America

Today, bicycles are elegantly simple machines that are common 
around the world. Many people ride bicycles for recreation, whereas 
others use them as a means of transportation. The irst bicycle, called 
a   draisienne  , was invented in Germany in 1818 by Baron Karl de Drais 
de Sauerbrun. Because it was made of wood, the   draisienne   wasn’t 
very durable nor did it have pedals. Riders moved it by pushing their 
feet against the ground.
In 1839, Kirkpatrick Macmillan, a Scottish blacksmith, invented 
a much better bicycle. Macmillan’s machine had tires with iron rims 
to keep them from getting worn down. He also used foot-operated 
cranks, similar to pedals, so his bicycle could be ridden at a quick 
pace. It didn’t look much like the modern bicycle, though, because 
its back wheel was substantially larger than its front wheel. Although 
Macmillan’s bicycles could be ridden easily, they were never pro-
duced in large numbers.
In 1861, Frenchman Pierre Michaux and his brother Ernest 
invented a bicycle with an improved crank mechanism. They called 
their bicycle a   vélocipède  , but most people called it a “bone shaker” 
because of the jarring effect of the wood and iron frame. Despite 
the unlattering nickname, the   vélocipède   was a hit. After a few years, 
the Michaux family was making hundreds of the machines annually, 
mostly for fun-seeking young people.
Ten years later, James Starley, an English inventor, made sev-
eral innovations that revolutionized bicycle design. He made the

front wheel many times larger than the back wheel, put a gear on the 
pedals to make the bicycle more eficient, and lightened the wheels 
by using wire spokes. Although this bicycle was much lighter and less 
tiring to ride, it was still clumsy, extremely top-heavy, and ridden 
mostly for entertainment.
It wasn’t until 1874 that the irst truly modern bicycle appeared 
on the scene. Invented by another Englishman, H. J. Lawson, the 
safety bicycle would look familiar to today’s cyclists. The safety 
bicycle had equal-sized wheels, which made it much less prone to 
toppling over. Lawson also attached a chain to the pedals to drive the 
rear wheel. By 1893, the safety bicycle had been further improved 
with air-illed rubber tires, a diamond-shaped frame, and easy brak-
ing. With the improvements provided by Lawson, bicycles became 
extremely popular and useful for transportation. Today, they are 
built, used, and enjoyed all over the world.
  370.    There is enough information in this passage to show that
a.   several people contributed to the development of the modern 
bicycle.
b.   only a few   vélocipèdes   built by the Michaux family are still in

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
One of the most hazardous conditions a ireighter will ever encoun-
ter is a backdraft (also known as a smoke explosion). A backdraft can 
occur in the hot-smoldering phase of a ire when burning is incom-
plete and there is not enough oxygen to sustain the ire. Unburned 
carbon particles and other lammable products, combined with the 
intense heat, may cause instantaneous combustion if more oxygen 
reaches the ire.
Fireighters should be aware of the conditions that indicate the 
possibility for a backdraft to occur. When there is a lack of oxygen dur-
ing a ire, the smoke becomes illed with carbon dioxide or carbon mon-
oxide and turns dense gray or black. Other warning signs of a potential 
backdraft are little or no visible lame, excessive heat, smoke leaving the 
building in puffs, mufled sounds, and smoke-stained windows.
Proper ventilation will make a backdraft less likely. Opening a 
room or building at the highest point allows heated gases and smoke 
to be released gradually. However, suddenly breaking a window or 
opening a door is a mistake, because it allows oxygen to rush in, caus-
ing an explosion.
  376.    A backdraft is a dangerous condition for ireighters mainly be-
cause
a.   there is not enough oxygen for breathing.
b.   the heat is extremely intense.
c.   the smoke is dangerously thick.
d.   an explosion occurs.
  377.    Which of the following is not mentioned as a potential backdraft 
warning sign?
a.   windows stained with smoke
b.   lames shooting up from the building
c.   puffs of smoke leaving the building
d.   more intense heat than usual

  378.    To prevent the possibility of a backdraft, a ireighter should
a.   carry an oxygen tank.
b.   open a door to allow gases to escape.
c.   make an opening at the top of the building.
d.   break a window to release carbon particles.
  379.    When compared with a hot, smoldering ire, a ire with visible, 
high-reaching lames
a.   has more oxygen available for combustion.
b.   has more carbon dioxide available for

c.   produces more dense gray smoke.
d.   is more likely to cause a backdraft.
The human body can tolerate only a small range of temperature, 
especially when the person is engaged in vigorous activity. Heat 
reactions usually occur when large amounts of water and/or salt are 
lost through excessive sweating following strenuous exercise. When 
the body becomes overheated and cannot eliminate this excess heat, 
heat exhaustion and heat stroke are possible.
Heat exhaustion is generally characterized by clammy skin, 
fatigue, nausea, dizziness, profuse perspiration, and sometimes faint-
ing, resulting from an inadequate intake of water and the loss of lu-
ids. First aid treatment for this condition includes having the victim 
lie down, raising the feet 8 to 12 inches, applying cool, wet cloths to 
the skin, and giving the victim sips of salt water (1 teaspoon per glass, 
half a glass every 15 minutes) over a 1-hour period.
Heat stroke is much more serious; it is an immediate life-threat-
ening situation. The characteristics of heat stroke are a high body 
temperature (which may reach 106° F or more); a rapid pulse; hot, 
dry skin; and a blocked sweating mechanism. Victims of this condi-
tion may be unconscious, and irst-aid measures should be directed 
at quickly cooling the body. The victim should be placed in a tub 
of cold water or repeatedly sponged with cool water until his or her 
temperature is suficiently lowered. Fans or air conditioners will also 
help with the cooling process. Care should be taken, however, not to 
over-chill the victim once the temperature is below 102° F.

No longer is asthma considered a condition with isolated, acute epi-
sodes of bronchospasm. Rather, asthma is now understood to be a 
chronic inlammatory disorder of the airways—that is, inlammation 
makes the airways chronically sensitive. When these hyperrespon-
sive airways are irritated, airlow is limited, and attacks of coughing, 
wheezing, chest tightness, and breathing dificulty occur.
Asthma involves complex interactions among inlammatory 
cells, mediators, and the cells and tissues in the airways. The inter-
actions result in airlow limitation from acute bronchoconstriction, 
swelling of the airway wall, increased mucus secretion, and airway 
remodeling. The inlammation also causes an increase in airway 
responsiveness. During an asthma attack, the patient attempts to 
compensate by breathing at a higher lung volume in order to keep 
the air lowing through the constricted airways, and the greater the 
airway limitation, the higher the lung volume must be to keep air-
ways open. The morphologic changes that occur in asthma include 
bronchial iniltration by inlammatory cells. Key effector cells in the 
inlammatory response are the mast cells, T lymphocytes, and eosino-
phils. Mast cells and eosinophils are also signiicant participants in 
allergic responses, hence the similarities between allergic reactions 
and asthma attacks. Other changes include mucus plugging of the 
airways, interstitial edema, and microvascular leakage. Destruction of 
bronchial epithelium and thickening of the subbasement membrane 
is also characteristic. In addition, there may be hypertrophy and 
hyperplasia of airway smooth muscle, increase in goblet cell number, 
and enlargement of submucous glands.
Although causes of the initial tendency toward inlammation 
in the airways of patients with asthma are not yet certain, to date 
the strongest identiied risk factor is atopy. This inherited familial 
tendency to have allergic reactions includes increased sensitivity to 
allergens that are risk factors for developing asthma. Some of these 
allergens include domestic dust mites, animals with fur, cockroaches, 
pollens, and molds. Additionally, asthma may be triggered by viral 
respiratory infections, especially in children. By avoiding these aller-

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
gens and triggers, a person with asthma lowers his or her risk of irri-
tating sensitive airways. A few avoidance techniques include: keeping 
the home clean and well ventilated, using an air conditioner in the 
summer months when pollen and mold counts are high, and getting 
an annual inluenza vaccination. Of course, asthma sufferers should 
avoid tobacco smoke altogether. Cigar, cigarette, or pipe smoke is a 
trigger whether the patient smokes or inhales   the smoke from others. 
Smoke increases the risk of allergic sensitization in children, increases 
the severity of symptoms, and may be fatal in children who already 
have asthma. Many of the risk factors for developing asthma may also 
provoke asthma attacks, and people with asthma may have one or 
more triggers, which vary from individual to individual. The risk can 
be further reduced by taking medications that decrease airway inlam-
mation. Most exacerbations can be prevented by the combination of 
avoiding triggers and taking anti-inlammatory medications. An excep-
tion is physical activity, which is a common trigger of exacerbations 
in asthma patients. However, asthma patients should not necessarily 
avoid all physical exertion, because some types of activity have been 
proven to reduce symptoms. Rather, they should work in conjunction 
with a doctor to design a proper training regimen, which includes the 
use of medication.
In order to diagnose asthma, a healthcare professional must 
appreciate the underlying disorder that leads to asthma symptoms 
and understand how to recognize the condition through information 
gathered from the patient’s history, physical examination, measure-
ments of lung function, and allergic status. Because asthma symp-
toms vary throughout the day, the respiratory system may appear 
normal during physical examination. Clinical signs are more likely 
to be present when a patient is experiencing symptoms; however, 
the absence of symptoms upon examination does not exclude the 
diagnosis of asthma.

Millions of people in the United States are affected by eating dis-
orders. More than 90% of those aflicted are adolescents or young 
adult women. Although all eating disorders share some common 
manifestations, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating 
each have distinctive symptoms and risks.
People who intentionally starve themselves (even while expe-
riencing severe hunger pains) suffer from anorexia nervosa. The 
disorder, which usually begins around the time of puberty, involves 
extreme weight loss to at least 15% below the individual’s normal 
body weight. Many people with the disorder look emaciated but are 
convinced they are overweight. In patients with anorexia nervosa, 
starvation can damage vital organs such as the heart and brain. To 
protect itself, the body shifts into slow gear: Menstrual periods stop, 
blood pressure rates drop, and thyroid function slows. Excessive 
thirst and frequent urination may occur. Dehydration contributes to 
constipation, and reduced body fat leads to lowered body tempera-
ture and the inability to withstand cold. Mild anemia, swollen joints, 
reduced muscle mass, and light-headedness also commonly occur in 
anorexia nervosa.

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
Anorexia nervosa sufferers can exhibit sudden angry outbursts 
or become socially withdrawn. One in ten cases of anorexia nervosa 
leads to death from starvation, cardiac arrest, other medical com-
plications, or suicide. Clinical depression and anxiety place many 
individuals with eating disorders at risk for suicidal behavior.
People with bulimia nervosa consume large amounts of food 
and then rid their bodies of the excess calories by vomiting, abusing 
laxatives or diuretics, taking enemas, or exercising obsessively. Some 
use a combination of all these forms of purging. Individuals with 
bulimia who use drugs to stimulate vomiting, bowel movements, or 
urination may be in considerable danger, as this practice increases 
the risk of heart failure. Dieting heavily between episodes of binging 
and purging is common.
Because many individuals with bulimia binge and purge in 
secret and maintain normal or above normal body weight, they can 
often successfully hide their problem for years. But bulimia nervosa 
patients—even those of normal weight—can severely damage their 
bodies by frequent binge eating and purging. In rare instances, binge 
eating causes the stomach to rupture; purging may result in heart 
failure due to loss of vital minerals such as potassium. Vomiting can 
cause the esophagus to become inlamed and glands near the cheeks to 
become swollen. As in anorexia nervosa, bulimia may lead to irregular 
menstrual periods. Psychological effects include compulsive stealing 
as well as possible indications of obsessive-compulsive disorder, an 
illness characterized by repetitive thoughts and behaviors. Obsessive-
compulsive disorder can also accompany anorexia nervosa. As with 
anorexia nervosa, bulimia typically begins during adolescence. Even-
tually, half of those with anorexia nervosa will develop bulimia. The 
condition occurs most often in women but is also found in men.
Binge-eating disorder is found in about 2% of the general pop-
ulation. As many as one-third of this group are men. It also affects 
older women, though with less frequency. Recent research shows 
that binge-eating disorder occurs in about 30% of people participat-
ing in medically supervised weight-control programs. This disorder 
differs from bulimia because its sufferers do not purge. Individuals 
with binge-eating disorder feel that they lose control of themselves 
when eating. They eat large quantities of food and do not stop until 
they are uncomfortably full. Most sufferers are overweight or obese 
and have a history of weight luctuations. As a result, they are prone

to the serious medical problems associated with obesity, such as high 
cholesterol, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Obese individuals also 
have a higher risk for gallbladder disease, heart disease, and some 
types of cancer. Usually they have more dificulty losing weight and 
keeping it off than do people with other serious weight problems. 
Like anorexic and bulimic sufferers who exhibit psychological prob-
lems, individuals with binge-eating disorder have high rates of simul-
taneously occurring psychiatric illnesses, especially depression.

Greyhound racing is the sixth most popular spectator sport in the 
United States. Over the last decade, a growing number of racers have 
been adopted to spend their retirement as household pets, once their 
racing careers are over.
Many people hesitate to adopt a retired racing greyhound 
because they think only very old dogs are available. Actually, even 
champion racers only work until they are about three-and-a-half 
years old. Because greyhounds usually live to be 12 to 15 years old, 
their retirement is much longer than their racing careers.
People worry that a greyhound will be more nervous and active 
than other breeds and will need a large space to run. These are false 
impressions. Greyhounds have naturally sweet, mild dispositions, 
and while they love to run, they are sprinters rather than distance 
runners and are suficiently exercised with a few daily laps around a 
fenced-in backyard.
Greyhounds do not make good watchdogs, but they are very 
good with children, get along well with other dogs (and usually cats 
as well), and are affectionate and loyal. They are intelligent, well-
behaved dogs, usually housebroken in only a few days. A retired 
racing greyhound is a wonderful pet for almost anyone.
  402.    Based on the tone of the passage, the author’s main purpose is to
a.   teach prospective owners how to transform their racing grey-
hound into a good pet.
b.   show how the greyhound’s nature makes it equally good as 
racer and pet.
c.   encourage people to adopt retired racing greyhounds.
d.   objectively present the pros and cons of adopting a racing grey-
hound.
  403.    According to the passage, adopting a greyhound is a good idea for 
people who
a.   do not have children.
b.   live in apartments.
c.   do not usually like dogs.
d.   already have another dog or a cat.

d.   less high-strung than those that are not available for adoption.
The lives of the Ancient Greeks revolved around   eris  , a concept by 
which they deined the universe. They believed that the world existed 
in a condition of opposites. If there was good, then there was evil, 
if there was love, then there was hatred; joy, then sorrow; war then 
peace; and so on. The Greeks believed that good   eris   occured when 
one held a balanced outlook on life and coped with problems as they 
arose. It was a kind of ease of living that came from trying to bring 
together the great opposing forces in nature. Bad   eris   was evident in 
the violent conditions that ruled men’s lives. Although these things 
were found in nature and sometimes could not be controlled, it was 
believed that bad   eris   occurred when one ignored a problem, letting 
it grow larger until it destroyed not only that person, but his family

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
as well. The Ancient Greeks saw   eris   as a goddess: Eris, the Goddess 
of Discord, better known as Trouble.
One myth that expresses this concept of bad   eris   deals with the 
marriage of King Peleus and the river goddess Thetis. Zeus, the 
supreme ruler, learns that Thetis would bear a child strong enough to 
destroy its father. Not wanting to father his own ruin, Zeus convinces 
Thetis to marry a human, a mortal whose child could never challenge 
the gods. He promises her, among other things, the greatest wedding 
in all of Heaven and Earth and allows the couple to invite whom-
ever they please. This is one of the irst mixed marriages of Greek 
Mythology and the lesson learned from it still applies today. They 
do invite everyone . . . except Eris, the Goddess of Discord. In other 
words, instead of facing the problems brought on by a mixed mar-
riage, they turn their backs on them. They refused to deal directly 
with their problems and the result is tragic. In her fury, Eris arrives, 
ruins the wedding, causes a jealous feud between the three major 
goddesses over a golden apple, and sets in place the conditions that 
lead to the Trojan War. The war would take place 20 years in the 
future, but it would result in the death of the only child of the bride 
and groom, Achilles. Eris would destroy the parents’ hopes for their 
future, leaving the couple with no legitimate heirs to the throne.
Hence, when we are told, “If you don’t invite trouble, trouble 
comes,” it means that if we don’t deal with our problems, our prob-
lems will deal with us . . . with a vengeance! It is easy to see why the 
Greeks considered many of their myths learning myths, for this one 
teaches us the best way to defeat that which can destroy us.
  408.    According to the passage, the ancient Greeks believed that the 
concept of   eris   deined the universe

She suffered, feeling that every luxury should rightly have been 
hers. The poverty of her rooms—the shabby walls, the worn fur-
niture, the ugly upholstery caused her pain. All these things that 
another woman of her class would not even have noticed, made 
her angry. The very sight of the little Breton girl who cleaned for 
her awoke rueful thoughts and the wildest dreams in her mind. She 
dreamt of rooms with Oriental hangings, lighted by tall, bronze 
torches, and with two huge footmen in knee breeches made drowsy 
by the heat from the stove, asleep in the wide armchairs. She dreamt 
of great drawing rooms upholstered in old silks, with fragile little 
tables holding priceless knickknacks, and of enchanting little sitting 
rooms designed for tea-time chats with famous, sought-after men 
whose attentions all women longed for.
She sat down to dinner at her round table with its three-day-old 
cloth, and watched her husband lift the lid of the soup tureen and 
delightedly exclaim: “Ah, a good homemade beef stew! There’s noth-
ing better!” She visualized elegant dinners with gleaming silver and 
gorgeous china. She yearned for wall hangings peopled with knights 
and ladies and exotic birds in a fairy forest. She dreamt of eating the 
pink lesh of trout or the wings of grouse. She had no proper ward-
robe, no jewels, nothing. And those were the only things that she 
loved—she felt she was made for them. She would have so loved to 
charm, to be envied, to be admired and sought after.

Arteries of the heart blocked by plaque can reduce the low of blood 
to the heart possibly resulting in heart attack or death. Plaque is 
actually fat and cholesterol that accumulates on the inside of the 
arteries. The arteries of the heart are small and can be blocked by 
such accumulations. There is a medical procedure that creates more 
space in the blocked artery by inserting and inlating a tiny balloon 
into the blood vessel. It is called coronary balloon angioplasty.   Angio-
plasty   means “blood vessel repair.” When the balloon is inlated, it 
compresses the plaque against the wall of the artery, creating more 
space and improving the low of blood.
Many doctors choose this technique, because it is less invasive 
than bypass surgery. Yes, both involve entering the body cavity, but 
in bypass surgery, the chest must be opened, the ribs must be cut, 
and the section of diseased artery must be removed and replaced. 
To replace it, the patient’s body is opened, once again, to acquire a 
healthy section of artery. Usually, this blood vessel is removed from 
an artery located in the calf of the leg. This means the patient now 
has two painful incisions that must heal at the same time. There is far 
more risk in such bypass surgery than in angioplasty, which involves 
threading a thin tube, called a catheter, into the circulatory system 
and working it to the damaged artery.
Angioplasty may take between 30 minutes to 3 hours to com-
plete. It begins with a distinctive dye that is injected into the blood-
stream. A thin catheter is then inserted into the femoral artery of the 
leg, near the groin. The doctor monitors the path of the dye using 
x-rays. He moves the tube through the heart and into the plaque-
illed artery. He inlates the balloon, creating more space, delates 
the balloon, and removes the tube. It is important to note that the 
plaque has not been removed; it has just been compressed against the 
sides of the artery. Sometimes, a   stent   may be implanted, a tiny tube 
of stainless steel that is expandable when necessary. Its function is to 
keep the artery open.

There is good news and there is bad news. The good news is that 
the statistics compiled are superb. Ninety percent of all angioplasty 
procedures are successful. The risk of dying during an operation of 
this type is less than 2%. The risk of heart attack is also small: 3–5%. 
Yet heart surgeons do not take any risk lightly; therefore, a team 
of surgeons stands ready to perform bypass surgery if needed. The 
length of hospitalization is only three days. The bad news is twofold. 
First, this procedure treats the condition but does not eradicate the 
cause. In 20% of the cases, there is a recurrence of plaque. Second, 
angioplasty is not recommended for all patients. The surgeons must 
consider the patient’s age, physical history, how severe the blockage 
is, and, inally, the degree of damage to the artery before they make 
their determination.

could be
a.   stroke.
b.   heart attack.

The next passages are typical of those you might ind in textbooks. The 
paragraphs are numbered for convenience.
(1) For centuries, time was measured by the position of the sun with 
the use of sundials. Noon was recognized when the sun was the high-
est in the sky, and cities would set their clock by this apparent solar 
time, even though some cities would often be on a slightly different 
time. Daylight Saving Time (DST), sometimes called summer time, 
was instituted to make better use of daylight. Thus, clocks are set 
forward one hour in the spring to move an hour of daylight from 
the morning to the evening and then set back one hour in the fall to 
return to normal daylight.
(2) Benjamin Franklin irst conceived the idea of daylight saving 
during his tenure as an American delegate in Paris in 1984 and wrote 
about it extensively in his essay, “An Economical Project.” It is said 
that Franklin awoke early one morning and was surprised to see the 
sunlight at such an hour. Always the economist, Franklin believed 
the practice of moving the time could save on the use of candlelight, 
as candles were expensive at the time. 
(3) In England, builder William Willett (1857–1915) became a 
strong supporter for Daylight Saving Time upon noticing blinds of 
many houses were closed on an early sunny morning. Willet believed 
everyone, including himself, would appreciate longer hours of light 
in the evenings. In 1909, Sir Robert Pearce introduced a bill in the 
House of Commons to make it obligatory to adjust the clocks. A bill 
was drafted and introduced into Parliament several times but met 
with great opposition, mostly from farmers. Eventually, in 1925, 
it was decided that summer time should begin on the day follow-
ing the third Saturday in April and close after the irst Saturday in 
October.
(4) The U.S. Congress passed the Standard Time Act of 1918 
to establish standard time and preserve and set Daylight Saving Time 
across the continent. This act also devised ive time zones throughout 
the United States: Eastern, Central, Mountain, Paciic, and Alaska. 
The irst time zone was set on “the mean astronomical time of the 
seventy-ifth degree of longitude west from Greenwich” (England). 
In 1919, this act was repealed. 
(5) President Roosevelt established year-round Daylight Sav-
ing Time (also called War Time) from 1942–1945. However, after

this period, each state adopted its own DST, which proved to be 
disconcerting to television and radio broadcasting and transporta-
tion. In 1966, President Lyndon Johnson created the Department of 
Transportation and signed the Uniform Time Act. As a result, the 
Department of Transportation was given the responsibility for the 
time laws. During the oil embargo and energy crisis of the 1970s, 
President Richard Nixon extended DST through the Daylight Sav-
ing Time Energy Act of 1973 to conserve energy further. This law 
was modiied in 1986, and Daylight Saving Time was reset to begin 
on the irst Sunday in April (to spring ahead) and end on the last 
Sunday in October (to fall back).

(1) Milton Hershey was born near the small village of Derry Church, 
Pennsylvania, in 1857. It was a __________ beginning that did not 
foretell his later popularity. Milton only attended school through the 
fourth grade; at that point, he was apprenticed to a printer in a nearby 
town. Fortunately for all chocolate lovers, Milton did not excel as a 
printer. After a while, he left the printing business and was appren-
ticed to a Lancaster, Pennsylvania candy maker. It was apparent he 
had found his calling in life, and at the age of eighteen, he opened 
his own candy store in Philadelphia. In spite of his talents as a candy 
maker, the shop failed after six years.
(2) It may come as a surprise to current Milton Hershey fans, 
but his irst candy success came with the manufacture of caramel. 
After the failure of his Philadelphia store, Milton headed for Denver, 
where he learned the art of making caramels. There he took a job 
with a local manufacturer who insisted on using fresh milk in mak-
ing his caramels; Milton saw that this made the caramels especially 
tasty. After a time in Denver, Milton once again attempted to open 
his own candy-making businesses, in Chicago, New Orleans, and 
New York City. Finally, in 1886, he went to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, 
where he raised the money necessary to try again. This company—
the Lancaster Caramel Company—established Milton’s reputation 
as a master candy maker.

(3) In 1893, Milton attended the Chicago International Expo-
sition, where he saw a display of German chocolate-making imple-
ments. Captivated by the equipment, he purchased it for his Lancaster 
candy factory and began producing chocolate, which he used for 
coating his caramels. By the next year, production had grown to 
include cocoa, sweet chocolate, and baking chocolate. The Hershey 
Chocolate company was born in 1894 as a subsidiary of the Lancaster 
Caramel Company. Six years later, Milton sold the caramel company, 
but retained the rights, and the equipment, to make chocolate. He 
believed that a large market of chocolate consumers was waiting for 
someone to produce reasonably priced candy. He was right.
(4) Milton Hershey returned to the village where he had been 
born, in the heart of dairy country, and opened his chocolate manu-
facturing plant. With access to all the fresh milk he needed, he began 
producing the inest milk chocolate. The plant that opened in a small 
Pennsylvania village in 1905 is today the largest chocolate factory 
in the world. The confections created at this facility are favorites 
around the world.
(5) The area where the factory is located is now known as Her-
shey, Pennsylvania. Within the irst decades of its existence, the town 
of Hershey thrived, as did the chocolate business. A bank, a school, 
churches, a department store, even a park and a trolley system all 
appeared in short order; the town soon even had a zoo. Today, a 
visit to the area reveals the Hershey Medical Center, Milton Hershey 
School, and Hershey’s Chocolate World—a theme park where visitors 
are greeted by a giant Reeses Peanut Butter Cup. All of these things—
and a huge number of happy chocolate lovers—were made possible 
because a caramel maker visited the Chicago Exposition of 1893!
  432.    According to information contained in the passage, the reader can 
infer which of the following?
a.   Chocolate is popular in every country in the world.
b.   Reeses Peanut Butter Cups are manufactured by the Hershey 
Chocolate Company.
c.   Chocolate had never been manufactured in the United States 
before Milton Hershey did it.
d.   The Hershey Chocolate Company now makes more money 
from Hershey’s Chocolate World than from the manufacture 
and sale of chocolate.

(1) By using tiny probes as neural prostheses, scientists may be able to 
restore nerve function in quadriplegics and make the blind see or the 
deaf hear. Thanks to advanced techniques, a single, small, implanted 
probe can stimulate individual neurons electrically or chemically and 
then record responses. Preliminary results suggest that the micro-
probe telemetry systems can be permanently implanted and replace 
damaged or missing nerves.
(2) The tissue-compatible microprobes represent an advance 
over the typical aluminum wire electrodes used in studies of the cor-
tex and other brain structures. Researchers accumulate much data 
using traditional electrodes, but there is a question of how much 
damage they cause to the nervous system. Microprobes, which are 
about as thin as a human hair, cause minimal damage and disruption 
of neurons when inserted into the brain.
(3) In addition to recording nervous-system impulses, the 
microprobes have minuscule channels that open the way for deliv-
ery of drugs, cellular growth factors, neurotransmitters, and other 
neuroactive compounds to a single neuron or to groups of neurons. 
Also, patients who lack certain biochemicals could receive doses via 
prostheses. The probes can have up to four channels, each with its 
own recording/stimulating electrode.
  438.    One similar feature of microprobes and wire electrodes is
a.   a minimal disturbance of neurons.
b.   the density of the material.
c.   the capacity for multiple leads.
d.   their ability to generate information.
 439.    Which of the following best expresses the main idea of the passage?
a.   Microprobes require further techno-logical advances before 
they can be used in humans.
b.   Wire electrodes are antiquated as a means for delivering neuro-
active compounds to the brain.
c.   Microprobes have great potential to help counteract neural 
damage.
d.   Technology now exists that may enable repair of the nervous 
system.

(1) Medical waste has been a growing concern because of recent inci-
dents of public exposure to discarded blood vials, needles (sharps), 
empty prescription bottles, and syringes. Medical waste can typically 
include general refuse, human blood and blood products, cultures 
and stocks of infectious agents, laboratory animal carcasses, contami-
nated bedding material, and pathological wastes.
(2) Wastes are generally collected by gravity chutes, carts, or 
pneumatic tubes, each of which has its own advantages and disad-
vantages. Chutes are limited to vertical transport, and there is some 
risk of exhausting contaminants into hallways if a door is left open 
during use. Another disadvantage of gravity chutes is that the waste 
container may get jammed while dropping, or it may be broken upon 
hitting the bottom. Carts are primarily for horizontal transport of 
bagged or containerized wastes. The main risk here is that bags 
may be broken or torn during transport, potentially exposing the 
worker to the wastes. Using automated carts can reduce the potential 
for exposure. Pneumatic tubes offer the best performance for waste 
transport in a large facility. Advantages include high-speed move-
ment, movement in any direction, and minimal intermediate storage 
of untreated wastes. However, some objects cannot be conveyed 
pneumatically.
(3) Off-site disposal of regulated medical wastes remains a viable 
option for smaller hospitals (those with less than 150 beds). Some pre-
liminary on-site processing, such as compaction or hydropulping, may 
202
6801_501_ReadingCompQuest_4E[fin].indd   202  3/18/10   1:34:59 PM
 = Page 214 =
501     Reading Comprehension Questions
be necessary prior to sending the waste off site. Compaction reduces 
the total volume of solid wastes, often reducing transportation and 
disposal costs, but it does not change the hazardous characteristics of 
the waste. Compaction may not be economical if transportation and 
disposal costs are based on weight rather than volume.
(4) Hydropulping involves grinding the waste in the presence of 
an oxidizing luid, such as hypochlorite solution. The liquid is sepa-
rated from the pulp and discharged directly into the sewer unless local 
limits require additional pretreatment prior to discharge. The pulp 
can often be disposed of at a landill. One advantage is that waste can 
be rendered innocuous and reduced in size within the same system. 
Disadvantages are the added operating burden, dificulty of controlling 
fugitive emissions, and the dificulty of conducting microbiological 
tests to determine whether all organic matters and infectious organ-
isms have been destroyed from the waste.
(5) On-site disposal is a feasible alternative for hospitals gen-
erating two tons or more per day of total solid waste. Common 
treatment techniques include steam sterilization and incineration. 
Although other options are available, incineration is currently the 
preferred method for on-site treatment of hospital waste.
(6) Steam sterilization is limited in the types of medical waste it 
can treat, but is appropriate for laboratory cultures and/or substances 
contaminated with infectious organisms. The waste is subjected to 
steam in a sealed, pressurized chamber. The liquid that may form 
is drained off to the sewer or sent for processing. The unit is then 
reopened after a vapor release to the atmosphere, and the solid waste 
is removed for further processing or disposal. One advantage of 
steam sterilization is that it has been used for many years in hospitals 
to sterilize instruments and containers and to treat small quantities of 
waste. However, since sterilization does not change the appearance 
of the waste, there could be a problem in gaining acceptance of the 
waste for landilling.
(7) A properly designed, maintained, and operated incinerator 
achieves a relatively high level of organism destruction. Incineration 
reduces the weight and volume of the waste as much as 95% and is 
especially appropriate for pathological wastes and sharps. The most 
common incineration system for medical waste is the controlled-air 
type. The principal advantage of this type of incinerator is low par-
ticulate emissions. Rotary-kiln and grate-type units have been used, 
203

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
but use of grate-type units has been discontinued because of high air 
emissions. The rotary kiln also puts out high emissions, and the costs 
have been prohibitive for smaller units.

a.   incineration.

them—that is, in their immediate context.
(1) The worst and longest economic crisis in the modern industrial 
world, the Great Depression in the United States had devastating 
consequences for American society. At its lowest depth (1932–33), 
more than 16 million people were unemployed, more than 5,000 
banks had closed, and over 85,000 businesses had failed. Millions of 
Americans lost their jobs, their savings, and even their homes. The 
homeless built shacks for temporary shelter—these emerging shan-
tytowns were nicknamed Hoovervilles; a bitter homage to President 
Herbert Hoover, who refused to give government assistance to the 
jobless. The effects of the Depression—severe unemployment rates 
and a sharp drop in the production and sales of goods—could also be 
felt abroad, where many European nations still struggled to recover 
from World War I.
(2) Although the stock market crash of 1929 marked the onset 
of the depression, it was not the   cause   of it: Deep, underlying issures 
already existed in the economy of the Roaring Twenties. For exam-
ple, the tariff and war-debt policies after World War I contributed 
to the instability of the banking system. American banks made loans 
to European countries following World War I. However, the United 
States kept high tariffs on goods imported from other nations. These 
policies worked against one another. If other countries could not sell 
goods in the United States, they could not make enough money to 
pay back their loans or to buy American goods.
(3) And while the United States seemed to be enjoying a pros-
perous period in the 1920s, the wealth was not evenly distributed. 
Businesses made gains in productivity, but only one segment of the

only a small share of the wealth they helped produce. At the same 
time, Americans spent more than they earned. Advertising encour-
aged Americans to buy cars, radios, and household appliances instead 
of saving or purchasing only what they could afford. Easy credit 
policies allowed consumers to borrow money and accumulate debt. 
Investors also wildly speculated on the stock market, often borrow-
ing money on credit to buy shares of a company. Stocks increased 
beyond their worth, but investors were willing to pay inlated prices 
because they believed stocks would continue to rise. This bubble 
burst in the fall of 1929, when investors lost conidence that stock 
prices would keep rising. As investors sold off stocks, the market spi-
raled downward. The stock market crash affected the economy in the 
same way that a stressful event can affect the human body, lowering 
its resistance to infection.
(4) The ensuing depression led to the election of President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932. Roosevelt introduced relief measures 
that would revive the economy and bring needed relief to Ameri-
cans suffering the effects of the depression. In his 100 days in ofice, 
Roosevelt and Congress passed major legislation that saved banks 
from closing and regained public conidence. These measures, called 
the New Deal, included the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which paid 
farmers to slow their production in order to stabilize food prices; the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insured bank deposits 
if banks failed; and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which 
regulated the stock market. Although the New Deal offered relief, 
it did not end the Depression. The economy sagged until the nation 
entered World War II. However, the New Deal changed the rela-
tionship between government and American citizens, by expanding 
the role of the central government in regulating the economy and 
creating social assistance programs.

a.    government policies had nothing to do with it.
b.   the government immediately stepped in with assistance for the 
jobless and homeless.

(1) The atmosphere forms a gaseous, protective envelope around 
Earth. It protects the planet from the cold of space, from harmful 
ultraviolet light, and from all but the largest meteors. After travel-
ing over 93 million miles, solar energy strikes the atmosphere and 
Earth’s surface, warming the planet and creating what is known as 
the biosphere, the region of Earth capable of sustaining life. Solar 
radiation in combination with the planet’s rotation causes the atmo-
sphere to circulate. Atmospheric circulation is one important reason 
that life on Earth can exist at higher latitudes because equatorial heat 
is transported poleward, moderating the climate.
(2) The equatorial region is the warmest part of the earth because 
it receives the most direct and, therefore, strongest solar radiation. 
The plane in which the earth revolves around the sun is called the 
1
ecliptic  . Earth’s axis is inclined 23 degrees with respect to the ecliptic.   3
This inclined axis is responsible for our changing seasons because, 
as seen from the earth, the sun oscillates back and forth across the 
equator in an annual cycle. On or about June 21 each year, the sun 
1
reaches the Tropic of Cancer, 23 degrees north latitude. This is the 
3
northernmost point where the sun can be directly overhead. On or 
about December 21 of each year, the sun reaches the Tropic of Cap-
1
ricorn, 23 degrees south latitude. This is the southernmost point at   3
which the sun can be directly overhead. The polar regions are the 
coldest parts of the earth because they receive the least direct and, 
therefore, the weakest solar radiation. Here solar radiation strikes 
at a very oblique angle and thus spreads the same amount of energy 
over a greater area than in the equatorial regions. A static envelope

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
of air surrounding the earth would produce an extremely hot, unin-
habitable equatorial region, while the polar regions would remain 
inhospitably cold.
(3) The transport of water vapor in the atmosphere is an impor-
tant mechanism by which heat energy is redistributed poleward. 
When water evaporates into the air and becomes water vapor, it 
absorbs energy. At the equator, air saturated with water vapor rises 
high into the atmosphere where winds aloft carry it poleward. As 
this moist air approaches the polar regions, it cools and sinks back to 
earth. At some point, the water vapor condenses out of the air as rain 
or snow, releasing energy in the process. The now-dry polar air lows 
back toward the equator to repeat the convection cycle. In this way, 
heat energy absorbed at the equator is deposited at the poles and the 
temperature gradient between these regions is reduced.
(4) The circulation of the atmosphere and the weather it gener-
ates is but one example of the many complex, interdependent events 
of nature. The web of life depends on the proper functioning of these 
natural mechanisms for its continued existence. Global warming, the 
hole in the atmosphere’s ozone layer, and increasing air and water 
pollution pose serious, long-term threats to the biosphere. Given the 
high degree of nature’s interconnectedness, it is quite possible that 
the most serious threats have yet to be recognized.
 460.    Which of the following best expresses the main idea of the passage?
a.   The circulation of atmosphere, threatened by global warming 
and pollution, protects the biosphere and makes life on Earth 
possible.
b.   If the protective atmosphere around the earth is too damaged 
by human activity, all life on Earth will cease.
c.   Life on Earth is the result of complex interdependent events 
of nature, and some of these events are a result of human 
intervention.
d.   The circulation of atmosphere is the single most important 
factor in keeping the biosphere alive, and it is constantly threat-
ened by harmful human activity.

(1) There are two types of diabetes,   insulin-dependent   and   non-insulin-
dependent  . Between 90–95% of the estimated 13–14 million people 
in the United States with diabetes have non-insulin-dependent, or 
Type II, diabetes. Because this form of diabetes usually begins in 
adults over the age of 40 and is most common after the age of 55, it 
used to be called adult-onset diabetes. Its symptoms often develop 
gradually and are hard to identify at irst; therefore, nearly half of all 
people with diabetes do not know they have it. For instance, some-
one who has developed Type II diabetes may feel tired or ill without 
knowing why. This can be particularly dangerous because untreated 
212

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
diabetes can cause damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, 
and nerves. While the causes, short-term effects, and treatments of 
the two types of diabetes differ, both types can cause the same long-
term health problems.
(2) Most importantly, both types affect the body’s ability to use 
digested food for energy. Diabetes does not interfere with diges-
tion, but it does prevent the body from using an important product 
of digestion,   glucose   (commonly known as sugar), for energy. After a 
meal, the normal digestive system breaks some food down into glu-
cose. The blood carries the glucose or sugar throughout the body, 
causing blood glucose levels to rise. In response to this rise, the hor-
mone insulin is released into the bloodstream and signals the body 
tissues to metabolize or burn the glucose for fuel, which causes blood 
glucose levels to return to normal. The glucose that the body does 
not use right away is stored in the liver, muscle, or fat.
(3) In both types of diabetes, however, this normal process mal-
functions. A gland called the   pancreas  , found just behind the stomach, 
makes   insulin  . In people with insulin-dependent diabetes, the pan-
creas does not produce insulin at all. This condition usually begins 
in childhood and is known as Type I (formerly called juvenile-onset) 
diabetes. These patients must have daily insulin injections to survive. 
People with non-insulin-dependent diabetes usually produce some 
insulin in their pancreas, but their bodies’ tissues do not respond well 
to the insulin signal and, therefore, do not metabolize the glucose 
properly, a condition known as insulin resistance.
(4) Insulin resistance is an important factor in non-insulin-
dependent diabetes, and scientists are searching for the causes of 
insulin resistance. They have identiied two possibilities. The irst is 
that there could be a defect in the insulin receptors on cells. Like an 
appliance that needs to be plugged into an electrical outlet, insulin 
has to bind to a receptor in order to function. Several things can go 
wrong with receptors. For example, there may not be enough recep-
tors to which  insulin may bind, or a defect in the receptors may 
prevent insulin from binding. The second possible cause of insulin 
resistance is that, although insulin may bind to the receptors, the cells 
do not read the signal to metabolize the glucose. Scientists continue 
to study these cells to see why this might happen.
(5) There’s no cure for diabetes yet. However, there are ways to 
alleviate its symptoms. In 1986, a National Institute of Health panel 
213

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
of experts recommended that the best treatment for non-insulin-
dependent diabetes is a diet that helps one maintain a normal weight 
and pays particular attention to a proper balance of the different food 
groups. Many experts, including those in the American Diabetes 
Association, recommend that 50–60% of daily calories come from 
carbohydrates, 12–20% from protein, and no more than 30% from 
fat. Foods that are rich in carbohydrates, like breads, cereals, fruits, 
and vegetables, break down into glucose during digestion, causing 
blood glucose to rise. Additionally, studies have shown that cooked 
foods raise blood glucose higher than raw, unpeeled foods. A doctor 
or nutritionist should always be consulted for more of this kind of 
information and for help in planning a diet to offset the effects of 
this form of diabetes.

(1) The immune system is equal in complexity to the combined 
intricacies of the brain and nervous system. The success of the 
immune system in defending the body relies on a dynamic regula-
tory communications network consisting of millions and millions of 
cells. Organized into sets and subsets, these cells pass information 
back and forth like clouds of bees swarming around a hive. The result 
is a sensitive system of checks and balances that produces an immune 
response that is prompt, appropriate, effective, and self-limiting.
(2) At the heart of the immune system is the ability to distin-
guish between self and non-self. When immune defenders encoun-
ter cells or organisms carrying foreign or non-self molecules, the 
immune troops move quickly to eliminate the intruders. Virtually 
every body cell carries distinctive molecules that identify it as self. 
The body’s immune defenses do not normally attack tissues that 
carry a self-marker. Rather, immune cells and other body cells coexist 
peaceably in a state known as   self-tolerance.   When a normally func-
tioning immune system attacks a non-self molecule, the system has 
the ability to remember the speciics of the foreign body. Upon sub-
sequent encounters with the same species of molecules, the immune 
system reacts accordingly. With the possible exception of antibodies 
passed during lactation, this so-called immune system memory is 
not inherited. Despite the occurrence of a virus in your family, your 
immune system must learn from experience with the many millions 
of distinctive non-self molecules in the sea of microbes in which we 
live. Learning entails producing the appropriate molecules and cells 
to match up with and counteract each non-self invader.
(3) Any substance capable of triggering an immune response 
is called an   antigen  . Antigens are not to be confused with   allergens,   
which are most often harmless substances (such as ragweed pollen or 
cat hair) that provoke the immune system to set off the inappropriate 
and harmful response known as   allergy  . An antigen can be a virus, a

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
bacterium, a fungus, a parasite, or even a portion or product of one 
of these organisms. Tissues or cells from another individual (except 
an identical twin, whose cells carry identical self-markers) also act as 
antigens; because the immune system recognizes transplanted tissues 
as foreign, it rejects them. The body will even reject nourishing pro-
teins unless they are irst broken down by the digestive system into 
their primary, non-antigenic building blocks. An antigen announces 
its foreignness by means of intricate and characteristic shapes called 
epitopes,   which protrude from its surface. Most antigens, even the 
simplest microbes, carry several different kinds of epitopes on their 
surface; some may even carry several hundred. Some epitopes will be 
more effective than others at stimulating an immune response. Only 
in abnormal situations does the immune system wrongly identify self 
as non-self and execute a misdirected immune attack. The result can 
be a so-called autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis or sys-
temic lupus erythematosis. The painful side effects of these diseases 
are caused by a person’s immune system actually attacking itself.
  476.    What is the analogy used to describe the communications network

a.   the immune system’s memory
b.   immune troops eliminating intruders
c.   bees swarming around a hive

(1) An upsurge of new research suggests that animals have a much 
higher level of brainpower than previously thought. If animals do 
have intelligence, how do scientists measure it? Before deining ani-
mals’ intelligence, scientists deined what is not intelligence.   Instinct   
is not intelligence. It is a skill programmed into an animal’s brain by 
its genetic heritage. Rote conditioning is also not intelligence. Tricks 
can be learned by repetition, but no real thinking is involved.   Cuing  , 
in which animals learn to do or not to do certain things by following 
outside signals, does not demonstrate intelligence. Scientists believe 
that insight, the ability to use tools, and communication using human 
language are all effective measures of the mental ability of animals.
(2) When judging animal intelligence, scientists look for insight, 
which they deine as a lash of sudden understanding. When a young 
gorilla could not reach fruit from a tree, she noticed crates scattered 
about the lawn near the tree. She piled the crates into a pyramid, then 
climbed on them to reach her reward. The gorilla’s insight allowed 
her to solve a new problem without trial and error.
(3) The ability to use tools is also an important sign of intel-
ligence. Crows use sticks to pry peanuts out of cracks. The crow 
exhibits intelligence by showing it has learned what a stick can do. 
Likewise, otters use rocks to crack open crab shells in order to get 
at the meat. In a series of complex moves, chimpanzees have been 
known to use sticks and stalks in order to get at a favorite snack—
termites. To make and use a termite tool, a chimp irst selects just 
the right stalk or twig. He trims and shapes the stick, then inds the 
entrance to a termite mound. While inserting the stick carefully 
into the entrance, the chimpanzee turns it skillfully to it the inner 
tunnels. The chimp attracts the insects by shaking the twig. Then it 
pulls the tool out without scraping off any termites. Finally, he uses 
his lips to skim the termites into his mouth.

(4) Many animals have learned to communicate using human 
language. Some primates have learned hundreds of words in sign 
language. One chimp can recognize and correctly use more than 250 
abstract symbols on a keyboard. These symbols represent human 
words. An amazing parrot can distinguish ive objects of two different 
types. He can understand the difference between the number, color, 
and kind of object. The ability to classify is a basic thinking skill. He 
seems to use language to express his needs and emotions. When ill 
and taken to the animal hospital for his irst overnight stay, this par-
rot turned to go. “Come here!” he cried to a scientist who works with 
him. “I love you. I’m sorry. Wanna go back?”
(5) The research on animal intelligence raises important ques-
tions. If animals are smarter than once thought, would that change 
the way humans interact with them? Would humans stop hunting 
them for sport or survival? Would animals still be used for food, 
clothing, or medical experimentation? Finding the answer to these 
tough questions makes a dificult puzzle even for a large-brained, 
problem-solving species like our own.

lowing is the kind of intelligence or conditioning the situation 
describes?
a.   rote learning
b.   tools
c.   communication
d.   instinct
  485.    The underlined word   upsurge  , as it is used in the irst paragraph of 
the passage, most nearly means
a.   an increasingly large amount.
b.   a decreasing amount.
c.   a well-known amount.
d.   an immeasurable amount.

guage or geometric shapes that stand for words.
  488.    In paragraph 3, what conclusion can be reached about the chim-
panzee’s ability to use a tool?
a.   It illustrates high intelligence because he  
is able to get his food and eat it.
b.   It illustrates instinct because he faced a dificult task and accom-
plished it.
c.   It illustrates high intelligence because he stored knowledge 
away and called it up at the right time.
d.   It illustrates high intelligence because termites are protein-
packed.
  489.    Which of the following is not a sign of animal intelligence?
a.   shows insight
b.   cues
c.   uses tools
d.   makes a plan

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
(1) Photosynthesis is the process that plants use to convert sunlight 
into the food that they need to survive and grow. Most plants create 
some form of sugar from the sunlight, and this sugar is used by the 
plant as its primary food source.
(2) Plants actually need only three things to create this sugar: 
sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water. The sunlight reacts with the 
plant’s chlorophyll, a green chemical which is used to convert water 
and carbon dioxide into sugar.
(3) As a general rule, photosynthesis occurs in a plant’s leaves. 
The leaf contains chlorophyll, which reacts when sunlight strikes the 
leaf. It is also the chlorophyll which gives the leaf its typical green 
color, since photosynthesis absorbs most light rays except green, 
which are relected outwards.
(4) The process of photosynthesis produces more than just sugar, 
however. One byproduct of the process is oxygen, which is “exhaled” 
by the plant into the atmosphere. In fact, plant photosynthesis is one 
of the primary sources of oxygen generation on our planet, making 
plant life essential to almost all living things on earth.
  490.    According to paragraph 4, which of the following is a byproduct of 
photosynthesis?
a.   green pigment
b.   water
c.   carbon dioxide
d.   oxygen
  491.    The underlined word   essential  , as used in paragraph 4, most nearly 
means
a.   necessary.
b.   optional.
c.   fragrant.
d.   growing.

  492.    The passage explains that photosynthesis is 
a.   done in the plant stem.
b.   what makes plants edible.
c.   the way that plants feed themselves.
d.   the source of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
  493.    According to the passage, why do plant leaves look green?
a.   Leaves are actually   not   green.
b.   Photosynthesis absorbs all colors except green.
c.   Sugar is green.
d.   Photosynthesis requires green light to produce sugar.
  494.    After reading the passage, what can you conclude about  
photosynthesis?
a.   Chlorophyll is part of the ozone layer.
b.   Photosynthesis is the process that feeds a plant.
c.   Plants need oxygen to survive.
d.   The roots of a plant provide water.
 495.    After reading the passage, what can you infer about photosynthesis?
a.   Human life would not survive without plants.
b.   Chlorophyll tastes sweet.
c.   Sunlight has both good and bad effects on plants.
d.   Too much water can interfere with photosynthesis.

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
(1) Abraham Lincoln served as the 16th President of the United States, 
yet he never went to college. In fact, Lincoln had nearly no formal edu-
cation whatsoever, attending schools for less than a year throughout 
his childhood. Yet this should not be construed to mean that Lincoln 
was ignorant or unlearned; on the contrary, he was one of the most 
well-read leaders of the time. The fact is that Abraham Lincoln edu-
cated himself by studying books of religion, philosophy, and literature, 
and he continued his voracious reading throughout his life.
(2) A lack of public school education did not prevent Lincoln 
from becoming a great leader. He led the United States through 
four years of civil war, which threatened to divide the nation into 
two separate countries. He was a powerful opponent of slavery, and 
it was largely through his leadership that slavery was abolished in 
this country.
(3) Lincoln’s determination to educate himself through diligent 
reading also led to his reputation as a great orator—and even today 
his speeches are quoted and studied worldwide. He serves as an 
example of a great leader—and a great reader. His love of books and 
good literature enabled Abe Lincoln to rise to world renown.
  496.    What is the main idea of this passage?
a.   Abe Lincoln was the 16th President of the United States.
b.   Abe Lincoln demonstrated the value of reading.
c.   Abe Lincoln was a Republican.
d.   Abe Lincoln freed the slaves.
  497.    Lincoln accomplished all of the following EXCEPT
a.   preventing the United States from being divided.
b.   ending slavery.
c.   becoming a great leader.

a.   likely to become President.
b.   a person who makes reading a regular habit.
c.   someone who never went to school.
d.   probably poor.

  Answers
   365.   b.    The topic is the broad, general subject of a passage. The pas-
sage tells the reader about walnut trees, so that is its topic.
   366.   d.    The main idea is more speciic than the topic—it’s the point or 
idea which the author wants to prove to the reader. Choice   is   a
too broad; the passage is about walnut trees, not trees in gen-
eral. Choices   and   are true, but they are merely part of the   b  c
passage’s main idea. Choice   summarizes the entire passage.  d
   367.   a.     Something that is   abrasive   is rough or coarse, and cause friction 
when rubbed against other objects.
   368.   c.     The reader can infer that the author supports planting walnut 
trees, since he speaks of their great value and also gives instruc-
tions on what to plant next to them. None of the other choices 
can be supported from the passage.
   369.   a.     To   exude   is to exhale or to give off, the way that perfume “gives 
off” an odor. The walnut roots give off chemicals, exuding them 
out to the soil.
   370.   a.     This is the best choice because each paragraph of the pas-
sage describes an inventor whose machine was a step toward 
the modern bicycle. There is no evidence to support choice  .   b
Choices   and   are incorrect because they both make state-  c  d
ments that, according to the passage, are untrue.
   371.   d.    The fourth paragraph states that   James Starley   added a gear to 
the pedals.
   372.   d.    The passage gives the history of the bicycle. Choice   is incor-  a
rect because few opinions are included in the passage. There is 
no support for choices   and  .  b  c
   373.   b.    This information is clearly stated in the second paragraph. The 
iron rims kept the tires from getting worn down, and, therefore, 
the tires lasted longer. Choice   is incorrect because although   a
the iron rims probably did make the machine heavier, that was 
not Macmillan’s goal. Choice   is incorrect because no infor-  c
mation is given about whether iron-rimmed or wooden tires 
moved more smoothly. There is no support for choice  .  d

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
   374.   b.    Based on the paragraph, this is the only possible choice. Starley 
revolutionized   the bicycle; that is, he made many innovative 
changes. Based on the context, the other choices make no sense.
   375.   a.     This is the only choice that states an opinion. The writer can-
not be certain that the safety bicycle would look familiar to 
today’s cyclists; it is his or her   opinion   that this is so. The other 
choices are presented as facts.
   376.   d.    The irst two sentences of the passage indicate that a backdraft 
is dangerous because it is an explosion. The other choices are 
dangers, but they do not deine a backdraft.
   377.   b.    The second paragraph indicates that there is little or no visible 
lame with a potential backdraft. The other choices are listed at 
the end of the second paragraph as warning signs of a potential 
backdraft.
   378.   c.     This is stated in the last paragraph. Choice   is not mentioned   a
in the passage. The other choices would be useless or harmful.
   379.   a.     The passage indicates that hot, smoldering ires have little or 
no visible lame and insuficient oxygen. It can reasonably be 
inferred, then, that more oxygen would produce more visible 
lames.
   380.   d.    This is stated in the last paragraph (. . .   irst aid measures should 
be directed at quickly cooling the body  ). The other responses are 
irst aid for heat exhaustion victims.
   381.   b.    This is stated in the irst sentence of the second paragraph. 
Choices   and   are symptoms of heat stroke. Choice   is not   a  c  d
mentioned.
   382.   a.     Heat stroke victims have a   blocked sweating mechanism  , as stated 
in the third paragraph.
   383.   b.    This information is given in the second paragraph: If the victim 
still suffers from the symptoms listed in the irst sentence of the 
paragraph, the victim needs more water and salt to help with 
the   inadequate intake of water and the loss of luids   that caused 
those symptoms.
   384.   d.    Many asthma sufferers have an inherited tendency to have aller-
gies, referred to as   atopy   in the third paragraph.

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
   385.   b.    The fourth sentence of the second paragraph explains that dur-
ing an attack the person aflicted with asthma will compensate 
for constricted airways by breathing a greater volume of air.
   386.   c.     The irst sentence of the passage begins,   No longer  , indicating 
that in the past asthma was considered an anomalous inlamma-
tion of the bronchi. Now asthma is considered a chronic condi-
tion of the lungs.
   387.   b.    An exacerbation is usually deined as an   aggravation of symptoms   
or   increase in the severity   of a disease. However, in this passage, 
exacerbations   is interchangeable with   asthma attacks  .
   388.   a.     Although cramping may occur during asthma attacks, it is not 
mentioned in the passage. See the bottom half of the second 
paragraph for a full explanation of the morphological effects of 
an attack.
   389.   d.    The third paragraph discusses triggers in detail. Although using 
a fan in the summer months sounds good, an air conditioner 
is recommended when the pollen count is high. Family pets 
and cigarette smoke are all distinctly inlammatory to asthma 
sufferers. Only physical activity is touted as a possible symptom 
reducer.
   390.   a.     Because asthma symptoms vary throughout the day, relying on 
the presence of an attack or even just on the presence of a respi-
ratory ailment to diagnose asthma is lawed logic.
   391.   b.    All the individuals listed would glean a certain amount of knowl-
edge from the passage; however, a healthcare professional would 
ind the broad overview of the effects of asthma, combined with 
the trigger avoidance and diagnosis information, most relevant. 
A research scientist would likely have all this information already. 
A mother with an asthmatic child would probably not be inter-
ested in the diagnosis protocol. The antismoking activist prob-
ably would not ind enough fodder in this article.
   392.   d.    According to the last part of the third paragraph, second-hand 
smoke can increase the risk of allergic sensitization in children.
   393.   b.    See the third paragraph: “One in ten” (10% of) cases of anorexia 
end in death.

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
   394.   a.     See the second and third paragraphs for reference to heart 
problems with anorexia, the fourth and ifth paragraphs for dis-
cussion of heart problems with bulimia, and the last paragraph, 
where heart disease is mentioned, as a risk in obese people who 
suffer from binge-eating disorder.
   395.   c.     Near the end of the last paragraph, the passage indicates that 
binge-eating disorder patients experience high blood pressure.
   396.   d.    It is the other way around: 50% of people with anorexia develop 
bulimia, as stated near the end of the ifth paragraph.
   397.   b.    The irst sentence of the ifth paragraph tells us that bulimia 
sufferers are often able to keep their problem a secret, partly 
because they maintain a normal or above-normal weight.
   398.   c.     In the second paragraph, the thyroid gland function is men-
tioned as slowing down—one effort on the part of the body to 
protect itself.
   399.   a.     According to the second paragraph, dehydration contributes to 
constipation.
   400.   b.    As stated in the opening sentence of the fourth paragraph, buli-
mia patients may exercise obsessively.
   401.   d.    See the second sentence of the sixth paragraph. If as many as 
one-third of the binge-eating disorder population are men, 
it stands to reason that up to two-thirds are younger women, 
given that we have learned that about 90% of all eating disorder 
sufferers are adolescent and young adult women.
   402.   c.     The tone of the passage is enthusiastic in its recommendation 
of the greyhound as pet and, thereby, encourages people to 
adopt one. It does not give advice on transforming a greyhound 
(choice  ). Except to say that they love to run, the passage does   a
not spend equal time on describing the greyhound as racer 
(choice  ). The author’s tone is not objective (choice  ), but   b  d
rather enthusiastic.
   403.   d.    See the last paragraph. The passage does not mention   or  .   b  c
Choice   is clearly wrong; the passage states the opposite.  a
   404.   a.     See the irst paragraph. Choices  , , and   are not touched on   b  c  d
in the passage.
   405.   d.    See the last paragraph. Choices  , , and   are contradicted in   a  b  c
the passage.

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
   406.   d.    The enthusiastic tone of the passage seems meant to encourage 
people to adopt retired greyhounds. Choice   is wrong because   a
there is only one statistic in the passage (in the irst sentence), 
and it is not used to prove the point that greyhounds make good 
pets. Choice   is wrong because the author substantiates every   b
point with information. Choice   is wrong because the passage   c
does make the negative point that greyhounds do not make 
good watchdogs.
   407.   b.    See the end of the next to last sentence in the passage. Choices 
a  c  , , and   are not to be found in the passage.  d
   408.   b.    This is stated explicitly in the second sentence of the passage. 
Choice   is incorrect because only bad eris was deined as vio-  a
lent. Choice   deals with problems that belong in the domain   c
of mankind, not the universe. Choice   has no support in the   d
passage.
   409.   a.     Again, this is a deinition explicitly stated in the sixth sentence. 
Choice   is incorrect because a choice dealing with mankind   b
alone is too narrow for a deinition of eris, which deals with the 
entire universe. Choice   is incorrect because it only deals with   c
one action of the personiied concept in goddess form. Choice     d
has no support.
   410.   d.    This is stated in the third sentence of paragraph 2. Zeus did not 
want to sire [father] a child who could eventually overthrow 
him. According to the passage, he felt it was safer to arrange for 
the child’s father to be a mortal. There is no support in the pas-
sage for any of the other choices.
   411.   c.     This answer follows the logic of the previous answer. A mortal 
child could never challenge the gods   implies that Zeus feared that 
if the child were immortal, it would overthrow him. The other 
choices mention individual words that appear in the passage but 
have no support.

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
   412.   b.    The second to the last line in paragraph 2 tells us that Achilles 
was the son of Thetis and Peleus, and that the war will result in 
his death. Choice   is incorrect because there is no other men-  a
tion of Zeus or events in the Trojan War other than Achilles’ 
death. Choice   is incorrect because Eris purposely created the   c
conditions that would lead to the war to kill the child of the 
bride and groom. Choice   is incorrect because Achilles is the   d
son of Thetis and Peleus, the bride and groom of the myth.
   413.   c.     This lesson is discussed explicitly in paragraph 3. All other 
choices are irrelevant.
   414.   c.     The husband had a civil servant’s job and received a steady salary; 
the wife had a servant who cleaned for her. The couple lived in 
a dwelling that had several rooms. This implies that they lived 
comfortably. Choice   is incorrect because they obviously were   a
not impoverished. Choice   is incorrect because the wife had   b
a maid. Choice   is incorrect because this was the life the wife   d
wanted to have, but instead had   shabby walls, worn furniture   etc.
   415.   d.    This question relates to the previous one. This choice pres-
ents the fact that the wife had a maid. Choice   does not deal   a
with the couple’s economic standing, but only the wife’s before 
she was married. Choice   is tempting, but the poverty of her   b
rooms is more in her eyes than a truthful economic indicator. 
How poverty stricken can she be if she has a maid? Choice     c
deals with a tablecloth that has been used three days in a row. It 
has nothing to do with economic standing because it could have 
been washed by the maid or the wife, and the situation would 
have been remedied.
   416.   a.     It is obvious from the description of the wife’s thoughts in the 
irst paragraph that she wished she had married a rich man. 
Instead, she   slipped into marriage with a minor civil servant  . The 
woman is ashamed of her marriage and of her husband’s oc-
cupation to the point of making it sound like an accident, as 
one may slip on a wet loor. Choices  , , and   are incorrect   b  c  d
because the wife loving anything other than expensive things is 
never mentioned in the passage.

501     Reading Comprehension Questions
   417.   b.    The husband’s delight with the homemade stew only seems 
to send his wife into another bout of daydreams to escape her 
middle-class prison. Choice   is blatantly incorrect, because the   a
husband obviously enjoys homemade beef stew while the wife 
dreams of wings of grouse. Choice   is incorrect because the hus-  c
band is either unaware of his wife’s anguish or doesn’t let it affect 
his delight in his dinner. Choice   is irrelevant to the passage.  d
   418.   d.    This is reinforced by the last two sentences of the passage. The 
wife admits she only loves rich things, believes she was made for 
them, and focuses all her desires on being   admired and sought  
after  , thinking only of herself at all times. Choice   is incor-  a
rect because the author paints a negative picture of the wife. 
Although choice   is tempting, the author does not develop the   b
husband enough for him to become the focus of the passage. 
Choice   is incorrect because it is not developed in the passage.   c
The focus is on the wife, not on class distinctions in general.
   419.   a.     Adjectives are the words that describe nouns. These are the 
words that truly add dimension to the descriptions of the home 
and the daydreams of the wife.   Innate instinctive grandest gor-  ,   ,   , 
geous gleaming  ,   , and   pink   are some of the adjectives that enrich 
the nouns of the wife’s dreams.   Shabby worn ugly  ,   ,   , and   homemade   
are adjectives that add to the undesirable view she has of her 
present situation. None of the other choices add such richness to 
the passage.
   420.   b.    This answer is explicitly stated in the irst sentence of the selec-
tion. Choices   and   are not mentioned as a result of plaque-  a  d
laden arteries. Choice   is too general to be the best answer.  c
   421.   c.     This answer is explicitly stated in the sixth sentence of paragraph 
1. Choice   only names one medical instrument used during   a
the procedure. Choice   offers the reason for the angioplasty,   b
because it is done to compress the plaque in an artery. Choice 
d   offers a procedure that would be chosen as an alternative to 
angioplasty.
   422.   a.     The irst and second sentences of paragraph 2 state how both 
procedures, angioplasty and bypass surgery, are invasive because 
“both involve entering the body cavity.” None of the other 
choices are supported or implied as a deinition for invasive.

   423.   c.     The procedure is detailed in paragraph 3. It begins with inject-
ing a special dye. Choices   and   follow later in the procedure,   a  b
whereas choice   deals with bypass surgery rather than the   d
angioplasty procedure.
   424.   d.    This answer can be found in paragraph 4. A team of surgeons 
stands ready to perform bypass surgery even though the risk 
factor of death is only 2%. Choice   is not supported in the   a
passage. Choices   and   are incorrect because the passage does   c  d
not discuss patient reaction at all.
   425.   a.     This choice is supported in the last sentence of paragraph 
3. Choice   is incorrect: The risk factor is 2%. Choice   is a   b  c
complete misunderstanding of the text. Inlating a balloon into 
a blocked artery is coronary balloon angioplasty. Because two 
answers are incorrect,   is not a viable choice.  d
426.   d.    Choices  and  , meaning scattered and erratic respectively,   b   c
are not supported in the passage. Choice   may be considered   a
a synonym, but it is not the best choice. The best choice is  ,   d
requisite  .
427.   b.    Paragraph 2 of the passage clearly states that Benjamin Franklin 
irst considered the concept of DST.
428.   b.    Paragraph 3 states that the bill (which was introduced by Sir 
Robert Pearce in 1909) met with great opposition, mostly from 
farmers.
429.   d.   This choice is directly supported by paragraph 5.
430.   a.     Choices   and   are incorrect because they each refer to speciic   b  c
points raised in the passage, but not throughout the passage. 
Choice   is too broad to represent the best title. Only choice     d  a
describes the point of the entire passage.
431.   c.     Paragraph 5 clearly states that during the oil embargo and 
energy crisis of the 1970s, President Richard Nixon extended 
DST through the Daylight Saving Time Energy Act of 1973 to 
conserve energy further.

   432.   b.    This is an inference question. The writer indicates that visi-
tors to Hershey’s Chocolate World are greeted by a giant 
Reeses Peanut Butter Cup, so it is logical to assume that these 
are manufactured by Hershey. Although the writer mentions 
the popularity of chocolate internationally, you cannot assume 
that it is popular in every country (choice  ), nor is there any   a
indication that Milton Hershey was the irst person to manufac-
ture chocolate in the United States (choice  ). Choice   is not   c  d
discussed in the passage at all.
   433.   d.    This question tests your ability to use context clues to deter-
mine the intended meaning of a word. In paragraph 3, the 
passage says,   The Hershey Chocolate company was born in 1894 as a 
subsidiary of the Lancaster Caramel Company  . This indicates that 
a subsidiary is one controlled by another company, choice  .   d
Although it may be true that Milton Hershey owned each com-
pany in its entirety (choice  ), that is not clear from the mate-  a
rial. There is also no indication that the chocolate company was 
created to support the caramel company (choice  ). Finally, the   b
passage contains no discussion of whether or not any of Her-
shey’s companies were incorporated (choice  ).  c
   434.   a.     Choice   is the best choice because it is the most complete   a
statement of the material. Choices   and   focus on small details   c  d
of the passage; choice   is not discussed in the passage.  b
   435.   b.    Paragraph 3 states that Hershey sold the caramel company six 
years after the founding of the chocolate company. The choco-
late company was founded in 1894; the correct choice is  .  b
   436.   c.     The Chicago International Exposition was where Hershey 
saw a demonstration of German chocolate-making techniques, 
which indicates, along with the word   international   in its title, 
that the exposition contained displays from a variety of coun-
tries, choice  . None of the other choices can be inferred from   c
the information in the passage.
   437.   b.    There is nothing inherently dramatic, undigniied, or rewarding 
discussed in paragraph 1.   Modest   is the word that best its being 
born in a small village and having the unremarkable early life 
described; it is also a word that provides a contrast to the men-
tion of Milton’s later popularity.

   438.   d.    The second sentence of paragraph 1 states that probes record 
responses. Paragraph 2 says that electrodes   accumulate much 
data  .
   439.   c.     The tone throughout the passage suggests the potential for 
microprobes. They can be permanently implanted, they have 
advantages over electrodes, they are promising candidates for 
neural prostheses, they will have great accuracy, and they are 
lexible.
   440.   d.    According to the third paragraph, people who   lack   biochemicals 
could receive doses via prostheses. However, there is no sugges-
tion that removing biochemicals would be viable.
   441.   a.     The irst sentence of the third paragraph says that microprobes 
have channels that   open the way for delivery of drugs  . Studying the 
brain (choice  ) is not the initial function of channels, though it   d
is one of the uses of the probes themselves.
   442.   b.    Throughout, the passage compares and contrasts the various 
methods of medical waste disposal.
   443.   d.    See the last sentence of paragraph 3. Compaction may well 
reduce transportation costs (choice  ) according to paragraph 3.   a
That it reduces the volume of waste (choice  ) is an advantage,   b
not a disadvantage. Compaction is not designed to eliminate  
organic matter, so conirming that it has been eliminated 
(choice  ) is not an issue.  c
   444.   a.     See the last sentence of paragraph 5, which states that   incinera-
tion is . . . the preferred method for on-site treatment  .
   445.   b.    See the last sentence of paragraph 6, which points out that 
steam sterilization does not change the appearance of the waste, 
thus perhaps raising questions at a landill.
446.   c.     Paragraph 4 states that liquid is separated from pulp in the 
hydropulping process. Paragraph 6 says that liquid may form 
during the sterilization process.
   447.   a.     This response relies on an understanding of pathological 
wastes, which are wastes generated by infectious materials. 
Paragraph 7 points out that incineration is especially appropri-
ate for pathological wastes. Previously, paragraph 6 had said 
that steam sterilization is appropriate for substances contami-
nated with infectious organisms.

   448.   d.    The second paragraph says that the main risk of pushing carts is 
potential exposure from torn bags but that automated carts can 
reduce that potential.
   449.   b.    See the next to last sentence of paragraph 4. Sterilization does 
not change the appearance of waste. Although compacting does 
change the volume of the waste, it is not appropriate for elimi-
nating hazardous materials.
   450.   d.    See the second sentence of paragraph 2:   . . . there is some risk of 
exhausting contaminants into hallways  , meaning waste might be 
discharged.
   451.   b.    See the last sentence of the passage, which states that   the costs 
have been prohibitive for smaller units   when using rotary kilns.
   452.   c.     Although the contaminants may sometimes be extremely toxic 
(choice  ), the word   a  fugitive   here is the key to the meaning. The 
words   fugitive emissions   are used in the context of the disposal 
process of hydropulping. To be a fugitive means to run away 
or to escape, so the logical choice, given this context, is choice 
c  . There is nothing anywhere in the passage about criminal 
activity, so choice   is not a likely answer. Choice   is wrong   b  d
because the microbiological testing of which the passage speaks 
pertains to ensuring that all waste is disposed of.
453.   c.     According to the paragraph 2,   Deep, underlying issures   that 
already existed in the economy   led to the Great Depression.
454.   a.     The passage is primarily an account that describes the causative 
factors (for example, tariff and war-debt policies, dispropor-
tionate wealth, and the accumulation of debt) that led to the 
Depression and its effects (for example, business failures, bank 
closings, homelessness, federal relief programs).
455.   c.     Paragraph 1 states that shantytowns were called   Hoovervilles   
because citizens blamed their plight on the Hoover administra-
tion’s refusal to offer assistance.
456.   b.    Although policies can refer to regulations or      laws   (choice  ) or   c
guiding principles or   theories   (choice  ), in this context,   a  policies   
refers to the courses of action that are taken, from which a gov-
ernment or business intends to inluence decisions or actions. 
Choice   is the only answer that implies action.  b

457.   d.    The passage describes the decade as one in which spending 
dominated over prudent measures like saving (paragraph 3). 
The wild stock market speculation, also described in that para-
graph, is another example of extravagance.
458.   b.    The analogy depicts the stock market crash of 1929 as a weak-
ening agent to the economy (the way a stressful event may 
weaken the body’s resistance to illness).
459.   d.    This paragraph clearly states that the New Deal expanded the 
role of the central government in regulating the economy and 
creating social assistance programs. Choices   and   are incor-  b  c
rect and choice   requires an opinion; the author does not offer   a
his or her viewpoint about the New Deal measures.
   460.   a.     Choice   emphasizes only damage to the atmosphere; the pas-  b
sage encompasses more than that. Choice   does not mention   c
the atmosphere, which is the main focus of the passage. Choice 
d   is too narrow—the inal paragraph of the passage emphasizes 
that the circulation of the atmosphere is but one example of the 
complex events that keeps the earth alive.
   461.   c.     This question assesses the ability to see the organization of a 
reading passage and to organize material for study purposes. 
Choice   is wrong because the passage does not explain exactly   a
what will happen as a result of damage to the atmosphere and 
other life-sustaining mechanisms. Choice   is wrong because   b
the passage does not explain the origin of the atmosphere. 
Choice   is wrong because it is solar energy that travels 93 mil-  d
lion miles through space, not the atmosphere.
   462.   b.    The   biosphere  , as deined in paragraph 1, is a   region   (or part) 
of the earth; it is not the envelope around the earth, the living 
things on Earth, or the circulation of the atmosphere (choices  ,  a  
c  , and  ).  d
   463.   d.    This question assesses the ability to recognize supported and 
unsupported claims. Choice   deals with solar radiation, not   a
with circulation of the atmosphere. Choice   is an assertion   b
without speciic supporting detail. Choice   describes how the   c
atmosphere protects Earth but does not speak of the circula-
tion of the atmosphere. Only choice   explains that conditions   d
would be inhospitable at the equator and poles without the 
circulation of the atmosphere; therefore, it is the best choice.

   464.   a.     This question assesses the ability to see cause and effect. Para-
graph 2 deals with how variations in the strength with which 
solar radiation strikes the earth affects temperature. None 
of the other choices is discussed in terms of all temperature 
changes on Earth.
   465.   a.     There is no mention in the irst paragraph of any   reviving   or 
cleansing   effect the atmosphere may have (choices   and  ). In   b  d
a sense, enabling the earth to sustain life is invigorating; how-
ever, choice   is a better choice because the irst two sentences   a
talk about how the atmosphere   protects   the earth from harmful 
forces.
   466.   b.    Paragraph 1 mentions that the symptoms of Type II diabetes 
may occur gradually and thus be attributed to other causes. Left 
untreated, diabetes can cause damage to several major organs in 
the body.
   467.   b.    According to the beginning of paragraph 2, only the long-term 
health problems are the same for these two different disorders.
   468.   d.    Paragraph 2 mentions that when the body has more glucose 
than needed, it stores the overlow in muscle tissue, fat, or the 
liver.
   469.  c.   According to the last paragraph, non-insulin-dependent diabetics 
should stick to a diet   consisting of 50–60% carbohydrates. The 
paragraph also notes that raw foods do not cause as high a blood 
sugar level as cooked foods.
   470.   a.     Paragraph 4 mentions that, although insulin must bind to a re-
ceptor in order to begin working, the main role of insulin is to 
signal the burning of glucose/sugar for energy. Most hormones 
function as stimuli for other processes.
   471.   b.    Type II, or non-insulin-dependent, diabetes is the main subject 
of the passage, which distinguishes Type II from Type I and 
goes on to stress the importance of diet.
   472.   d.    Paragraph 4 of the passage tells us that possible problems with 
insulin receptors include a paucity of receptors or a defect caus-
ing improper binding of the insulin to the receptors. In addition, 
even though insulin may bind to its receptors, cells may fail to 
read the signal to metabolize the glucose.

   473.   c.     Paragraph 2 states that normally, after the digestive system 
breaks down food into smaller molecules, including glucose 
(otherwise known as sugar), the blood-sugar level rises. Insulin 
is then released from the pancreas, thus signaling tissues to 
metabolize the glucose.
   474.   c.     Type I diabetes is the insulin-dependent form of this condition. 
The minority of diabetics are aflicted with this form. They are 
diagnosed as children and must take daily injections of insulin 
to compensate for what their pancreases do not produce.
   475.   a.     The inal paragraph says that there is no cure for diabetes, so 
choices   and   are incorrect. Choice   is a possibility, but con-  b  d  c
sider the sound of the word   soothe  . It does not it with the objec-
tive tone of the passage nearly as well as the word   counteract  .
   476.   c.     In the irst paragraph, the communication network of the mil-
lions of cells in the immune system is compared to bees swarm-
ing around a hive.
   477.   b.    All the answers indicate peaceful coexistence. However, accord-
ing to the ifth sentence of paragraph 2, in this instance, the 
state is referred to as   self-tolerance.
   478.   c.     See the last paragraph. The substances known as   allergens   are 
responsible for triggering an inappropriate immune response to 
ragweed pollen.
   479.   d.    The last paragraph of the passage mentions that an antigen an-
nounces its foreignness with intricate shapes called   epitopes   that 
protrude from the surface.
   480.   a.     Every individual’s immune system must learn to recognize and 
deal with non-self molecules through experience. However, the 
last section of paragraph 2 mentions that the immune system is 
capable of choices  , , and   b  c  d.
   481.   b.    According to paragraph 2, the ability to distinguish between self 
and non-self is the heart of the immune system. This topic is set 
up in the irst paragraph and further elucidated throughout the 
body of the passage.
   482.   b.    The last paragraph mentions that tissues or cells from another 
individual may act as antigens except in the case of identical 
twins whose cells carry identical self-markers.

   483.   a.     The context leads to the meaning: The irst sentence speaks of 
complexity, from which we can infer an elaborate system of in-
terconnections, especially in light of the second sentence. There 
is no mention of confusion in the passage (choice  ). The word   b
perplexity   means bewilderment and is unrelated to the passage 
(choice  ). Choice   is a newspaper and TV term that is    c  d
unrelated to the passage.
   484.   b.   The crow is using the stick as a tool to assist it in getting food.
   485.   a.     In the irst paragraph,   upsurge   (a swelling of the ocean) is used 
as an analogy to illustrate the large and increasing amount of 
research in animal intelligence.
   486.   c.     The questions in this paragraph ask the reader to consider the 
use of animals in our world and questions whether knowing 
that they have more intelligence than previously thought might 
make a difference in human treatment of them.
   487.   d.    This choice is the only one that shows animals using human 
language.
   488   c.     Although each conclusion is an example of some intelligence, 
the most accurate conclusion the reader should make is that 
this action shows high intelligence. The complexity of what the 
chimpanzee is doing to get his food and the many thinking activi-
ties he must accomplish in order to realize his goal of getting 
the termites—learning a new skill, selecting and shaping a tool, 
remembering stored knowledge, using the correct knowledge in 
order to take proper action for the situation—shows intelligence.
   489.   b.    Cuing does not demonstrate animal intelligence because the 
animal learns to do or not to do certain things by following 
outside signals.
   490.   d.    Photosynthesis produces sugar in a plant, and oxygen is a by-
product. The other choices may be involved in photosynthesis, 
but they are not byproducts.
   491.   a.     The passage states that photosynthesis produces oxygen, which 
is   necessary   for life on earth. None of the other choices it the 
context.
   492.   c.     The passage states that photosynthesis produces sugar, which 
the plant uses for food.

   493.   b.    The inal sentence in paragraph 3 states that green light is re-
lected by photosynthesis.
   494.   b.    This choice is the only one that can be concluded from the  
passage.
   495.   a.     Paragraph 4 states that photosynthesis produces oxygen; with-
out oxygen, human life could not exist on earth.
   496.   b.    Although all choices are true statements, only   states the main   b
idea.
   497.   d.    Statements  , , and   appear in the passage; this statement   a  b  c
does not.
   498.   b.   The passage only gives evidence that supports this answer.
   499.   d.   To   construe   something is to interpret it in a speciic way. 
   500.   c.     The passage uses Abraham Lincoln to illustrate the importance 
of good reading habits. It does not state that all books are worth 
reading, nor does it imply that education is unimportant.
   501.   b.   This is the only choice that the passage supports.
